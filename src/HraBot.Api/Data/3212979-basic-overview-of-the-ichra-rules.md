- **Company size**: ICHRA is available to employers of all sizes, including a 5-person startup, a 50-person team, or a 500-person corporation.
- **Annual Contribution Allowances**: No limit.
- **Reimbursement options**: Plans can be designed to include premiums only or premiums plus expenses.
- **Group plan interaction**: An ICHRA can be offered with a traditional group plan as long as both options aren't being offered to the same class of employees. Note: this does not preclude group dental and vision.
- **Owner eligibility**: Depending on the legal setup of the company, employers may be eligible to participate in ICHRA. For example, C-corp and non-profit owners can participate, while S-corp owners are not eligible (but can deduct expenses directly). It is recommended that business owners talk to an accountant before setting up an HRA.
