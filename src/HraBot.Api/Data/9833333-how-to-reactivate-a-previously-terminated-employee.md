# How to Reactivate a Previously Terminated Employee

What do I do when I re-hire an employee or when an employee becomes re-eligible?

[Log In to Access Your Employee Roster](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-roster)

If you have an employee that is being rehired or is becoming re-eligible for the benefit you can reactivate the employee from your admin portal!

- Visit the 'Employee Roster' tab and depending on how long the employee has been terminated, you will click into either the 'Suspended' tab or the 'Former' tab.

  Less than 90-days- Suspended. More than 90-days- Former.

- From there you can locate the employee and select the purple reactivate button next to their name.

- You can enter in the EEs new hire date or the date they became re-eligible.

- If your HRA has a waiting period, you can decide whether you would like the waiting period to re-apply or have the employee immediately eligible for the benefit.

  (Contact Take Command Support for help with adjusting the waiting period).
