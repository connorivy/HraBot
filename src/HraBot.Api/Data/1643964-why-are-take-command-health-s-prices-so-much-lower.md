# Why are Take Command Health's prices so much lower?

Our business model and aim is very different from most benefit brokers.

We don't make money by upselling benefits or add-ons, we try to pass great deals through to our users. We make money when an individual (ie, your employees) loves our service so much they choose to buy a health plan from us. We'll help them find the best plan with coverage for their doctors, prescriptions, and health needs.

If employees purchase through us, we typically get a small commission from the insurance company. In most cases, there's no cost to you or your employees.
