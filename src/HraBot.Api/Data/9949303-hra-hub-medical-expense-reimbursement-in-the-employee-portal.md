# HRA Hub; Medical Expense Reimbursement in the Employee Portal

## What is a Medical Expense?

A medical expense is any cost incurred for the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or care of a health-related condition. This includes a variety of services and purchases that directly contribute to your well-being and medical needs. Some common examples of medical expenses that may be eligible for reimbursement include:

- **Doctor's visits**: Fees for consultations, treatments, or procedures by medical professionals.
- **Prescription medications**: Costs of prescribed drugs used to treat or manage a health condition.
- **Hospital services**: Fees for inpatient or outpatient care, including surgeries, diagnostics, and therapies.
- **Medical equipment and supplies**: Purchases of necessary medical devices, such as crutches, insulin pumps, or hearing aids.
- **Vision and dental care**: Costs associated with routine dental checkups, cleanings, eyeglasses, or contact lenses, if covered by the company's plan.

Eligible medical expenses typically align with government regulations (such as IRS guidelines in the U.S.), and only expenses that meet the company's reimbursement policy will be approved.

## How Do I submit a medical expense?

1. Go to your HRA Hub dashboard.

2. Click the "Medical expense +" button or navigate to the Benefits tab in the left hand navigation and select "Medical Expenses".

3. Select the applicable family member that corresponds with the expense

4. Enter:
   - Cost of service
   - Date of service
   - Description of services

5. Upload your receipt or documentation

6. Attest that your individual health insurance coverage is active, your medical expense meets IRS guidelines, and that your expense has not been reimbursed previously.

**Note:** The date of service must be used (not the billing date). You may also need a letter of medical necessity for certain expenses.

## How Do I Know if My Medical Expense is Approved?

After you submit a medical expense for reimbursement, you can track its status through the dashboard. Here's how the approval process works:

- **Submission of Expense**: After you enter the details of your medical expense and upload any required documents (receipts, invoices), it will be sent to the Claims team for review.

- **Claims Team Review**: The Claims team will review your submission to ensure it meets eligibility criteria based on company policy and government regulations. This includes checking:
  - Documentation is complete.
  - The expense is valid and within the scope of eligible medical expenses.
  - Compliance with any legal or policy restrictions.

- **Status Update**: You can monitor the status of your expense submission through the dashboard. The typical status stages include:
  - **Pending**: The expense has been submitted and is waiting for review.
  - **Approved**: Your expense has met all criteria and will be reimbursed.
  - **Rejected**: The expense was not approved, often due to incomplete documentation or ineligibility. If rejected, you will be provided with the reason and guidance on next steps, such as resubmitting with additional information.

- **Notification**: You will also receive a notification (via email or the dashboard) once a decision has been made on your expense.
  - If approved, the notification will include details about the payment timeline.
  - If rejected, the notification will include the specific reasons for rejection and instructions on how to correct or appeal the decision.

- **Reimbursement**: Once approved, the medical expense will be processed, and the reimbursement will be added to your next payment cycle.

By keeping track of the status and following up on any rejections, you can ensure that your medical expenses are processed efficiently for reimbursement.

### Key Reminders

- You can submit expenses until for services that occurred in the current plan year (as long as your company's HRA is active with Take Command).
- Expenses are eligible based on the date of service, not the billing date.
- If your current balance is $0, you'll need to wait for funds to be available to receive reimbursement, but your submitted claims will still be reviewed and processed if and when you accrue available funds.
