# Can I participate in my company's QSEHRA if I am covered by my spouse's employer group plan?

Are my premium and expenses reimbursable if I am on my spouse's company group plan?

Yes, those covered on a spouse's employer group plan can participate in the QSEHRA. Remember: You must be covered by Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) to receive QSEHRA reimbursements. Coverage through a spouse's group plan does qualify as MEC.

**PREMIUMS**

If you're covered by your spouse's group plan there are some nuances to know regarding premium reimbursement:

- First, verify whether your employer has elected to include spouse group plans in the QSEHRA.
- Next, only the portion of the group premium that is not paid for by your spouse's company is eligible for reimbursement. For example, let's say your spouse's plan costs $1,000/mo total. Your spouse's company kicks in $400/mo to help cover the cost. Only the remaining $600 would be eligible for QSEHRA reimbursement (if allowed by the employer, see step 1 above).
- Finally, most group plans are already paid for on a pre-tax basis on your spouse's paycheck. In the example above, even though you're paying $600/mo to cover the difference, your spouse is likely able to pay for it pre-tax on his or her paycheck. This is great! However, the IRS doesn't want you to "double dip" and also get a pre-tax QSEHRA reimbursement. As a result, your QSEHRA claim for your premium will likely be paid on a taxable basis unless you can show the premiums were paid post-tax by your spouse (very rare).

See [IRS Notice 2017-67 Q48](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-17-67.pdf) if you'd like to dive into the weeds!

If you have an individual dental or vision plan, separate from your spouse's group health plan, those premiums can be reimbursed tax-free.
