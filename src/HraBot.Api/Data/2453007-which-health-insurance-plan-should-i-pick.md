# Which health insurance plan should I pick?

How do I know what plan to choose?

Our Plan Finder is designed to help you discover and compare all options for health insurance in your area. The decision on which plan is best for you is ultimately up to you and what is best for you and your family. There is no one best plan or insurance provider, but we're here to provide as much information as possible so that you can make an informed decision!

After you provide us with some details on you and your household, we'll show you all of the plans available in your area. There can be a lot, so we know it's a little overwhelming!

## How do I narrow it down?

You can search for your doctors and prescriptions, so you can see which carriers your doctor accepts, and how much your medications cost on each plan.

You'll also be able to filter out the many options based on insurance carriers, doctor networks (PPO, EPO, HMO), and the ease of enrollment. On your summary results page, you'll see all of that information on each plan, including our enrollment tags:

- **Easy Enroll**: Plans with this tag will have an easy, fast enrollment! This means that you can complete the enrollment directly on the Take Command Health site, and we will even set up your recurring claim for you automatically. Take Command Health can provide additional support to you if anything comes up on your plan. We can work with the carriers on your behalf!
- **Self Enroll**: For these plans, you'll need to enroll on your own, either directly with the carrier or with your state exchange. We will still help you narrow down which plan is best and then guide you on where to go from there. If an issue comes up with your plan, you'd need to call the carrier directly. We can always help provide guidance on how to do that, though
- **Pay Later**: Plans with this tag are also Easy Enroll in. For these plans, you'll receive a bill at some point after enrollment.

## We're here to help!
