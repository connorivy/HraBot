# How do I read my ICHRA Reimbursement Statement?

We'll walk you through how to read your Reimbursement Statement so you can reimburse your employees.

Take Command Health keeps track of the monthly premium payments and medical expenses employees have submitted for reimbursement. After claims are reviewed & approved, we report the final numbers to you on a [Reimbursement Statement](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) so that you can reimburse your employees directly. This will help protect your employee's privacy and save you time in tracking their expenses.

## Each Reimbursement Statement will show you what employees are owed based on allowances & claims applied since the last report ran.

Here is what your Reimbursement Statement will look like online:

Here's a few helpful definitions:

- **Current Allowance:** this month's allowance, applied on the 1st of each month.
- **Previous Allowance:** unclaimed allowance from previous months or years (if applicable).
- **Total Allowance:** Total allowance available for reimbursement this month.
- **Previous Unreimbursed Expenses:** claims submitted before this month that have not yet been reimbursed
- **New Claims:** claims submitted during this time frame.
- **Claims Subtotal:** Total unreimbursed claims submitted to date.
- **Reimbursement Total:** Amount to reimburse your employee. (if the employee's total allowance is less than the claims subtotal, then the reimbursement amount will = their total allowance)
