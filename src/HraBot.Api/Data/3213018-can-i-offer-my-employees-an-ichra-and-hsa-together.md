# Can I offer my employees an ICHRA and HSA together?

Yes. However, a successful integration depends on how the ICHRA is originally setup by the employer.

An ICHRA must be designed to only reimburse premiums (not premiums and expenses) in order for the employee to be eligible to make contributions to an HSA. Additionally, an individual must have a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) to participate in an HSA as well as carry an [ICHRA-compliant individual insurance plan](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/minimum-essential-coverage-and-individual-coverage-hra).
