# What should I do if my health insurance ID cards haven't arrived?

Do I have coverage and how should I access care?

## When to Expect Your Insurance Cards

It's not unusual for health insurance ID cards to arrive a bit after your policy starts, especially if it kicks in on the 1st of the month or at the beginning of a new plan year. Usually, it takes about 2-3 weeks after your first premium payment for your insurance provider to send out your cards. This initial payment, known as the binder payment, activates your plan and gets the ball rolling on your documentation.

## What to Do If Your Cards Are Delayed

If your insurance cards haven't shown up yet, don't worry! Here are some steps you can take:

- **Verify Your First Premium Payment**: Double-check that your first premium has been paid. This is crucial for activating your plan.
- **Check for Digital Options**: Some insurance companies send your member ID and group number in emails or welcome letters. You can use these details with your healthcare provider until you receive your physical card. Also, many insurers let you create an account on their website to download or print a temporary card.
- **Use Mobile Apps**: Lots of insurance companies have mobile apps where you can access a digital ID card. This can be super handy if you need proof of insurance right away.
- **Communicate with Your Healthcare Provider**: If you need to see a healthcare provider, let them know your insurance company, plan name, and the effective date. Ask if they can wait to submit claims until you have your card.
- **Pay Out-of-Pocket and Reimburse Later**: If you need to see a provider or refill a prescription before you get your card, you can pay out-of-pocket and submit your claim for reimbursement once you have your card.
- **Refill Prescriptions Early**: If you're eligible, refill any prescriptions before the new year.
- **Emergency Care**: If you need emergency care, go to the hospital! They're required to treat you, and you can sort out payment and insurance details later.
- **Contact Your Insurance Provider**: If you still need help, reach out directly to your insurance provider. Use their specific phone number or mention that you're enrolled in an individual plan to get to the right support team.
