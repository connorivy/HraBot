# HRA Hub; Find a Plan - I Already Have a Plan

This article guides you through what to do if you already have a plan to upload.

## Overview:

Employees have the option to bring their own insurance plan and get reimbursed for eligible premiums.

**Note:** If you have purchased a Self-Enroll AutoPay plan, you do **not** need to come back and upload your proof of coverage.

After entering your personal information, household income, family details, and viewing your allowance, choose to "upload your POC."

You must input the details of your existing insurance plan. This includes:

- **Insurance type**: Specify whether the plan is individual, Medicare or student health insurance
- **Carrier**: Name of the insurance company providing the plan.
- **Policy details**: Any relevant policy numbers or coverage information.

After entering your insurance details, upload valid Proof of Coverage (POC).

This step is essential to validate that you are actively enrolled in the plan you are submitting for reimbursement.

### Proof of Coverage Requirements

As a reminder, the requirements for Proof of Coverage documentation are as follows:

- Your name - (the name of the HRA-eligible person. If you are not the primary insured, then we will need to see that you are a covered dependent)
- The premium amount - (if you are claiming it for reimbursement)
- A current date - (a document dated within the last 30 days is considered current for compliance purposes)
- Statement of backdated coverage – (if you are claiming any premiums from past months)
- The name of the plan + provider- (ie: Gold/Silver/Bronze 1234 with Insurance Companies Logo)

A monthly bill or an Elections of benefits document often works best!

## Get Reimbursed

Once you have successfully submitted your POC and it is approved, the reimbursement process will be initiated. You will be set up for a recurring monthly reimbursement of your premium amount, UP TO your allowance given.
