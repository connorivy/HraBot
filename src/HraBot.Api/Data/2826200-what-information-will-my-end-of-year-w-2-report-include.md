# What information will my end-of-year W-2 report include?

What will Take Command Health provide to help me know what to report at tax time?

We issue W-2 reports in December to help you prepare your employees' Forms W-2. When they're ready, we'll send you an e-mail letting you know it is available for download in your member portal.

When you log into your admin account you will see the W-2 report listed in "Documents." There will be detailed instructions of how to use the information in the report to prepare your employee W-2s. We will report the total amount of QSEHRA benefit your employees were eligible for during the year, which you will report on Box 12 of the employee W-2 using code FF.
