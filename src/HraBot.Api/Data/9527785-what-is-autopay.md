# What is AutoPay?

The AutoPay payment solution simulates the same cashflow experience as a traditional group plan. Meaning, employers pay the insurance premiums upfront and then withhold the employee's portion from their paycheck as needed. AutoPay enables the convenience of a group plan with the personalization & choice of the individual market.

## Who can sign up for Autopay?

Employers utilizing our platform that have 30 or more participating employees.

## How does AutoPay work?

- Employer funds disbursement account with monthly transfers.
- Insurance companies pull payment from disbursement monthly. (Take Command can not initiate the payments)
- Employer withholds employee portion via payroll if premium exceeds allowance. (Take command will calculate the difference and provide it to the employer via the monthly report).

## How can my employee sign up for autopay?

The employee will select an AutoPay enabled plan in our portal & set up payments with the carrier. The employee will be provided a unique account number and routing number that can be provided directly to the carrier.

Easy Enroll: Take Command submits the application, sets up the recurring payments, and submits the proof of coverage.

Self Enroll: The employee enters in the provided AutoPay payment details when submitting the application on the carriers website. The employee is responsible for ensuring the carrier receives the payment each month. The employee is responsible for uploading their proof of coverage into the Take Command platform.
