# Can I participate in my company's ICHRA if I'm on a Sharing Plan?

Are Medi-Share, Samaritan, and other sharing ministries reimbursable through ICHRA?

Sharing ministries including Medi-Share do not qualify for participation under ICHRA. Learn more about this in a blog post that addresses [sharing ministries and ICHRA](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/health-care-sharing-ministries-and-ichra).
