# How and when will I be reimbursed?

How long does it take to receive my QSEHRA or ICHRA reimbursement?

Your employer will reimburse you directly for your reimbursement claims. Each month, Take Command Health will deliver a reimbursement statement to your employer so they know exactly how much to reimburse you. Some employers choose to add the reimbursements directly to payroll while others issue a separate payment for the claims.

When you submit a recurring premium or medical expense claim through your member portal, it will be reviewed and approved (or declined). Typically, this takes 1-3 business days, but can take up to 30 business days. You can always [check the status of your claims](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2745879-has-my-recurring-claim-been-approved) in your member portal.

From there, double check with your employer on how & when they plan to process reimbursements.
