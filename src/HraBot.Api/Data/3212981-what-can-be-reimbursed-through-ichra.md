# What can be reimbursed through ICHRA?

In addition to enabling employers to help employees pay for their individual heath insurance premiums tax-free, ICHRA also allows reimbursement for medical expenses such as copays, contacts and glasses, orthodontics, RX, etc. The list of qualified medical expenses is originally found in the IRS's [Publication 502](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf) (starting on page 5). Keep in mind employers can choose from this list so everything will not necessarily be included.
