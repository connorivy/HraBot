# Can ICHRA be used to reimburse employees with Preventative MEC (P-MEC) plans?

P-MEC and limited medical plans won't work with ICHRA. ICHRA requires eligible employees maintain individual coverage that meets ACA guidelines (including no cost sharing for preventive benefits and unlimited lifetime benefits). Most P-MEC and limited medical plans don't meet these criteria.

Since being offered ICHRA will trigger a [60 day Special Enrollment Period](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/employee-eligibility-requirements-ichra) for employees to purchase qualified plans from the marketplace, purchasing an ICHRA compliant plan will be easy for employees.
