# Is there a deadline to submit claims for reimbursement?

How long do I have to claim reimbursement for an expense after it is incurred?

All reimbursement claims must be submitted by March 31st following the year in which the expense was incurred, as outlined in your Employee Notice document and Plan Summary document. All Take Command Health HRA plan years follow the calendar year, so if your QSEHRA is set up during 2024, you will have until March 31, 2025 to submit a claim for insurance or service received during 2024.

The same will apply to ICHRA plans, employees with an active ICHRA in 2024 will have until March 31, 2025 to submit claims from 2024.

Even though you have 90 days into a new calendar year to submit claims from the entire prior year, it's definitely best practice to submit claims for reimbursement ASAP after you incur the expense in order to prevent misplacing receipts and losing potential benefit dollars.
