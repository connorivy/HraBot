# What type of plans can my employees get to qualify for ICHRA?

ICHRA eligible health insurance

## What does a Qualified Plan for ICHRA look like?

The Individual Coverage HRA requires employees and their dependents to be enrolled in individual health insurance for each month the employee and their family members are reimbursed through ICHRA. In order to be qualified individual coverage, it must meet the minimum requirements as outlined in [Public Health Services (PHS) Act Section 2711](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/2590.715-2711) and [Section 2713](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/2590.715-2713).

These two provisions require that the employee's plan has:

- **No annual or lifetime limits** on the dollar amount for coverage of essential health benefits
- **Full coverage of preventative health services** to be covered with no shared cost to the insured

In other words, the plan needs to meet Minimum Essential Coverage through an individual marketplace plan.

## Which Plans Qualify?

Different from other types of HRAs, with ICHRA, the ONLY types of health insurance that qualify are:

- Major Medical insurance offered on or off the Exchange (bronze, silver, or gold plans)
- Medicare (Part A and B together, or Part C)
- Catastrophic Coverage for qualified individuals
- Student health insurance
