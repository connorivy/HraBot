# How do I update my reimbursement statement date/frequency?

The date my reimbursement statement runs doesn't work for me- how do I change it?

Our system runs an automatic reimbursement statement for employers, that will tell you exactly how much each employee is owed in reimbursement! You can change the date and frequency of this statement at any time.

Log in to your admin portal, and go to the Reimbursements tab. In the right hand corner, you can see under "Automatic Statements" when your statements currently run:

If you'd like to change this, just click "Update." This screen will appear:
