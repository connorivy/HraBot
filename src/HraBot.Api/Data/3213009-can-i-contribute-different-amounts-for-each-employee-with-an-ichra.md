# Can I contribute different amounts for each employee with an ICHRA?

How can I vary reimbursement allowances between employees?

Yes, you can offer different amounts to employees within some set parameters. You can vary your reimbursement rates by classes of employees. Also, you can vary reimbursement rates within a given class of employees by number of dependents or age.

For reference, the ICHRA classes are as follows:

- Full-time employees
- Part-time employees
- Seasonal employees
- Employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement
- Employees in a waiting period
- Foreign employees who work abroad
- Employees working in the same geographic location (same insurance rating area, state, or multi-state region)
- Salaried workers
- Non-Salaried workers (such as hourly workers)
- Temporary employees of staffing firms
- A combination of two or more of the above
