# How to Check Proof of Coverage Status

To check your Proof of Coverage status all you will need to do is login to your Take Command Portal to view your dashboard. There you will see one of three options.

- Compliant
- Non-Compliant
- Reviewing

If your dashboard is showing the 'Compliant' status, that means your Proof of Coverage has been approved. You can scroll down or navigate to the 'health insurance' section to see any submissions you have made.

If your dashboard is reflecting the 'Non-Compliant' status, this means your Proof of Coverage has been declined. To correct your submission, you will simply need to select the 'edit' icon in the 'health insurance' section of your portal to submit the needed information. If you are needing to waive your benefit you will need to contact support to have your account reset.

If your dashboard is reflecting the 'reviewing' status, that means your Proof of Coverage is still in review by our Compliance Team. Please rest assured they will let you know directly in the event they need anything further to approve your submission!

If your dashboard is reflecting the 'expired' status, that means that your Previous submission has expired, and you will need to submit a New Proof of Coverage in order to continue receiving your reimbursements. You can navigate to the 'health insurance' section of your portal to submit this, or you can use the 'add monthly premium' button on the dashboard of your portal.
