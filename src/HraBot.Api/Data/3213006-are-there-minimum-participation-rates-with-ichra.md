# Are there minimum participation rates with ICHRA?

No, there are no minimum participation rates for ICHRA. This is a big difference over traditional group plans which typically require 70% participation.

**Note:** If you are offering a group plan to one employee class and ICHRA to others, minimum class sizes may apply. For more information on that, check out our [blog post about ICHRA classes & how they work.](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/how-do-the-ichra-classes-work)
