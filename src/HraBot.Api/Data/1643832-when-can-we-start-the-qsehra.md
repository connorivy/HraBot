# When can we start the QSEHRA?

Getting Started

You can set up the QSEHRA and start making reimbursements at any time.

However, employees need to have compliant coverage to be able to participate. If they already have their own plan or are on their spouse's plan, great! If they need to purchase a plan, they can do it during Open Enrollment (Nov and Dec) or if they qualify for a Special Enrollment Period (requires a qualifying life event). Becoming eligible for a HRA also counts as a qualifying life event for your employees to purchase new coverage! Our design experts can help you decide when you should start your QSEHRA.

**Note:** If you currently offer a group plan, canceling it will trigger a special enrollment period and allow your employees to purchase an individual plan.
