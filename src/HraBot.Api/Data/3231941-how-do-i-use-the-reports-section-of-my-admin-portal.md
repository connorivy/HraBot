# How do I use the Reports section of my Admin portal?

When and how to use the Reports section of your portal

---

The [Reports](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reports) section of the Admin portal is designed to give you a greater understanding of how your employees are using their reimbursement allowance. We do not recommend using these reports for processing reimbursements. When you're ready to process a reimbursement, go to the [Reimbursements](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) section of your portal to view your reimbursement statements.

Rather, these reports are meant to do the following:

- Provide more context to your employees' reimbursements & claims.
- Help you understand how we calculated the amount each employee is owed in your Reimbursement Statements.
- Provide a more comprehensive year-to-date or month-by-month summary of information.

# There are two reports available in the Reports section of your member portal: Reimbursements Summary & Claims Summary.

## Reimbursements Summary Report

This report will show you reimbursement amounts broken down by employee on a monthly basis. You can set this report to run on a custom date range. It's an interactive report, so you can click on the reimbursement totals for more information.

## Claims Summary Report

This report will show you a year-to-date summary of each employee's allowances, claims, reimbursements, and accumulated unclaimed allowance. It's also an interactive report, so you can click into each category for more information.

If you'd like to toggle back and forth from your Admin or Employer portal to your employee portal, click on your name in the upper right corner of the screen, then select "Switch to Employee Profile."
