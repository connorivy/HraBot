# Can I participate in my company's ICHRA if I'm on my spouse's employer group plan?

Am I eligible for reimbursement through ICHRA if I am covered through my spouse's employer?

Unfortunately, no. If you are covered under your spouse's employer group plan, you are not eligible to participate in your company's ICHRA.

The Individual Coverage HRA requires employees and their dependents to be enrolled in individual health insurance for each month the employee and their family members are reimbursed through ICHRA, meaning it must be secured through the individual market.
