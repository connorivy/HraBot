# I enrolled for a plan through Take Command Health, what's next?

That's great! We're excited you've joined us. We'll send you a confirmation email that will have more information, but at a high level here's what will happen next.

- We'll review your application and make sure we don't need any extra information. We'll let you know if we need anything.
- We'll send your application in to your carrier and make sure they get it. Usually we do this within 24 hours, unless there is unusually high volume. We'll send an email when we've done this.
- Your carrier will review your application and determine if you're covered. This can take a few days, or up to 2 weeks depending on the time. Some carriers are good about notifying you right away when the policy is accepted, while others don't say much. Either way, we make sure to follow up with your carrier and notify you when we've received confirmation.
