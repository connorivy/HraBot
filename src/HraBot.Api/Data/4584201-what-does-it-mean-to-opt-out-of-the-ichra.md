What Does It Mean to Opt Out of the ICHRA?

Opting out of the Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) is an important decision. Here's what you need to know:

**When to Opt Out:**

- If your ICHRA is considered "unaffordable," you have the option to opt-out. This means you can decline the ICHRA and instead accept the premium tax credit for yourself and any family members enrolled in the Marketplace.

**Important Note:**

- If you waive coverage through an ICHRA and it is considered affordable, you cannot claim the premium tax credit for yourself or any family members.
