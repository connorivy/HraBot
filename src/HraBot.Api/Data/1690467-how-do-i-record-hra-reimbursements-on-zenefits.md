# How do I record HRA reimbursements on Zenefits?

How to setup and make QSEHRA & ICHRA reimbursements through Zenefits

## Tax-Free Reimbursements

A recurring reimbursement should be added to the employee's [pay template](https://help.zenefits.com/Payroll/Using_Zenefits_Payroll/Learn_about_Pay_Templates_in_Zenefits_Payroll/04-Reimbursements_in_Employee_Pay_Templates) so that the reimbursement is added to each automatically generated pay run. If there's currently a Draft run, the reimbursement will be added to that run as well.

1. In payroll, click Employees, and click on the employee's name.
2. Click the Pay Template tab.
3. Scroll down to the Reimbursements section, and click +Add New Reimbursement.
4. Choose the reimbursement type, and enter the amount.
5. Repeat the steps above for each eligible employee
