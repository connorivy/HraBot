# HRA Hub; My Info - Shopping for Medicare

Medicare shopping

Once you have filled out your personal information and reviewed your documents, you will be routed to our partner 'Chapter' if you are Medicare-eligible. You will not be shopping on the Take Command platform directly.

As a concierge service for those in need of Medicare coverage, Take Command has partnered with Chapter to make it easy to sign up for Medicare plans that are reimbursable through your employer-sponsored ICHRA. The process is simple, streamlined and coordinated. A coverage option is selected from leading insurance companies based on where you live and your individual needs, then submit proof of coverage to Take Command Health, along with receipts for eligible care, and get reimbursed tax-free.

When directed to their page, you will be able to make an appointment and/or schedule a phone call with a representative.

After the appropriate coverage is purchased, you will return to Take Command and upload proper documentation of your coverage to utilize your allowance as reimbursement.

## Family members:

If your spouse is Medicare eligible, you will not shop on the Take Command platform. You will also upload documentation to the platform to allow for reimbursement.

Medicare Eligible employees cannot shop for any dependent(s) on the Take Command platform. You would also upload documentation to the platform to allow for reimbursement of their plan(s).
