# Where can I update my QSEHRA configurations?

## I want to make a change to my QSEHRA, what should I do?

An awesome perk of having a QSEHRA is that you can update your plan configurations at any time! There are a few changes you can make yourself in your admin portal, but most changes will need to be made by the Take Command Health team.

You can always view your current plan configurations under Settings > 2024 QSEHRA. If you want to change any of those configurations (reimbursement rates, exclusions, or compliance check frequency), just send us a chat in the bottom right-hand corner and we'll update that for you! Please give our team the following information!

{The 2025 QSEHRA allowance maximums are: $6,350 ($529.16/ month) for single employees and $12,800 ($1066.66 / month) for families.}

If you want to update your Reimbursement Statement date, you can do that in your [Admin Portal](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) under Reimbursements. Just click on "Update" in the box in the top right, and you can update the frequency and timing of your automatic statements. It'll look like this:

You can also update any company or billing information, or add administrators, in the Settings tab!

If you need to make other changes, or if you aren't sure, please just let us know by chatting with us in the bottom right-hand corner, or emailing [support@takecommandhealth.com](mailto:support@takecommandhealth.com)! We'll be happy to make any changes for you.
