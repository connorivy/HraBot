# Shopping for Dental and Vision Plans

This article is about shopping for dental and vision plans through our partners.

We do not currently have a Vision partnership, however we do offer dental insurance through two partnerships: [Insurance for Everyone](#insurance-for-everyone-dental-and-vision) and [Renaissance Dental](#renaissance-dental).

# Insurance for Everyone Dental and Vision

Take Command Health partners with AmFirst for dental benefits. This option will be offered after choosing a plan on our platform. Plan prices range by zip code, age, and family size. Proof of Coverage (POC) will need to be uploaded by the employee.

Plan will be offered on our shopping platform or available via our partner landing page here:

[Brokers IFE (insuranceforeveryone.com)](https://brokers.insuranceforeveryone.com/?Portal=17414586-001)

There are no waiting periods with AmFirst.

When an EE logs into the site, they will see plans from the following carriers:

- Carington Discount Dental Plan
- Nationwide
- Renaissance Dental
- AmFirst (these are plans that have been designed to go with an ICHRA)
- Delta Dental

The carriers will vary by location.

Payments are normally drafted on the 18th of the month by default. The member can choose any day between the 1st and the 20th if they would like to change their draft date. They would make that change in their AmFirst member portal.

AmFirst has plans designed with HRAs in mind. EE's will have the option to enroll in an AmFirst plan, or other carrier plans as well.

Note that individual dental insurance works differently - there is a maximum per year which is essentially the opposite of MOOP in that the maximum is the maximum amount the plan will pay in a plan year.

## Networks

AmFirst, Standard Life and Nationwide dental products all utilize the Careington's Maximum Care network. This network has over 353,000 access points nationwide.

Delta Dental uses their own network and can be searched at: [Search (deltadentalins.com)](https://www.deltadentalins.com/find-a-dentist/)

## Other Products Offered

The focus of AmFirst is the Dental offerings, however, they do offer Vision, Identity and TeleMed plans. An EE can enroll in one of these plans, however ONLY the DENTAL & Vision are reimbursable under an ICHRA/QSEHRA.

# Renaissance Dental

We have partnered with [Renaissance Dental](https://www.myrencoverage.com/takecommand/) to allow our clients to offer their employees affordable dental insurance that can be reimbursed tax-free with their HRA.

Here's what their dental plans through Take Command offer:

- **Affordable pricing.** Single-member plans starting at $40 per month, with $50 individual deductible and $1,000 annual maximum.
- **No waiting periods.** Typically, there are 6-month waiting periods before a cavity can be filled, but with the Take Command offering through Renaissance Dental, waiting periods have been waived.
- **100% coverage for diagnostic and preventative services.** No charge to you when you receive diagnostic, preventative service or annual cleaning from an in-network provider.
- **Robust networks.** Renaissance has an extensive footprint with more than 300,000 top quality providers across the country.
- **No copays**
- **Great customer service!**

# Is your dentist in network with Renaissance Dental?

Renaissance Dental has an extensive network of partner providers (300,000+ dental providers, in fact!). [Follow this link](https://www.myrencoverage.com/takecommand/) for a provider search tool to check if your favorite dentist is in network. Their provider search tool will be a better resource than calling your dentist and asking about Renaissance Dental.

**Pro-tip:** Take Command's plan with Renaissance Dental allows you to go to any dentist, but you'll save on out-of-pocket costs if you stick with in-network providers.

# HRAs and Dental Insurance

Your HRA can be used to reimburse for medical premiums, as well as premiums for dental and vision insurance. If your employer also reimburses for medical expenses, your leftover HRA dollars (after paying your premiums) can cover the costs that dental insurance does not, alleviating out-of-pocket costs.

# How to get set up with dental insurance

On the Take Command platform, when you're done shopping for medical insurance, you'll be prompted to select whether or not you want a dental plan. If you choose to, you'll be directed to Renaissance Dental's partner site. And remember, you'll only see this option to select a dental plan if your employer has selected to make it available.

## Here are the steps to sign up for a dental plan on our platform:

1. Shop for medical insurance on the Take Command platform.
2. The platform will ask if you want to shop for dental insurance. Say yes!
3. You'll be redirected to our partner, Renaissance Dental, to complete your enrollment.
4. Set up a recurring premium on the Take Command portal.
5. Get reimbursed on your paycheck for dental premiums.
6. Visit a participating dentist and their office will complete and file claims for you.
