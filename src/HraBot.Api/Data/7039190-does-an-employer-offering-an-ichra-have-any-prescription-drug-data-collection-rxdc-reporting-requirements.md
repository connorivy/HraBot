# Does an employer offering an ICHRA have any Prescription Drug Data Collection (RxDC) Reporting Requirements?

How do the new RxDC reporting requirements impact ICHRA?

No, an employer offering an ICHRA (or QSEHRA) does not have reporting requirements for RxDC. The [instructions from CMS](https://regtap.cms.gov/reg_librarye.php?i=3860) clearly state that account-based plans, such as health reimbursement arrangements, are not required to submit.

For employees enrolled in an individual market plan and participating in an ICHRA (or QSEHRA), the health insurance issuer does the reporting.
