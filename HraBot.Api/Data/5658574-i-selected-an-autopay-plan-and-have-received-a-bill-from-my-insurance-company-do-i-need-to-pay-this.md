# I selected an AutoPay plan and have received a bill from my insurance company. Do I need to pay this?

I received a bill from my insurance company but my HRA plan is Autopay. What do I do?

Nope! Your insurance company will definitely send you a monthly bill, but your payments are taken care of by us. You do not need to pay this. You will also receive a confirmation email once we have paid the bill. **An important thing of note:** In your employee portal, your status will say "Pending" until the bill has been paid or up until three business days before you could lose coverage. If you notice your status has changed to red and says "Urgent" or "Risk of Cancellation" to avoid losing coverage, go ahead and pay the bill immediately, then contact us.

To avoid making out-of-pocket payments, please note that your autopay payment details will always be available in your employee portal settings.
