# How do I add my newborn baby to my plan?

Congratulations on your new addition to the family! When you expand your family through the birth of a child, adoption or foster care, you have 60 days to add your newest addition to your insurance plan. Here are the steps to take to ensure you get insurance coverage for your child:

- Call your insurance company within 60 days of child's birth
- Have their birth certificate handy for verification
- Rest assured that once the insurance is approved, it will start the day your child was born, so any immediate doctor's visits within the first few weeks will be covered
