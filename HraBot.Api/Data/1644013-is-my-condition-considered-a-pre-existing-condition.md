# Is my condition considered a "pre-existing condition?"

Is my pre-existing condition covered?

Before explaining what counts as a pre-existing condition, remember that this only matters for alternative plans, such as faith-based share plans, short-term plans, and other non-[MEC](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/managing-my-qsehra/qsehra-onboarding/what-qualifies-as-minimum-essential-coverage-mec) plans.

# Major medical plans are required to cover pre-existing conditions.

If you are applying for a major medical plan, then you don't need to worry about whether your condition is pre-existing, because it's covered!

# General Guidelines for Pre-Existing Conditions

The bottom line is that whether or not your condition is considered a pre-existing condition depends on your coverage. Each provider has their own definition of what qualifies as a pre-existing condition.

In general, A pre-exisiting condition is something you have been seen by a doctor for already, anything you may be taking medication for, any change of medications in the last 6-12 months.

# Pre-Existing Conditions with Medi-Share

Here's how Medi-Share defines pre-existing conditions, which is a good guideline for other alternative plans:

Medi-Share won't deny you for a pre-existing condition, but there may be a "phase-in" period before you'll get full coverage. As an example, if you're pregnant and then sign up for Medi-Share, it won't be covered.
