# What do I do if my spouse and I both have an HRA?

Who's HRA plan do I use If we both have one?

Knowing how to navigate the insurance landscape can be hard enough, but what if you and your spouse are both offered HRA plans by your employer?

## For QSEHRA:

If both you and your spouse work for the same employer, non-owner spouses can both participate, and both receive the family rate. (if the company configs vary by family size)

## For ICHRA:

The same rules apply, but for applicable large employers, it's based on the company.

## So for the possible scenarios based on the type of plan:

- Both get the full family allowance
- One claims single, and one claims kids (if any). If no kids, both claim single.
- One waives participation and the other claims married or family allowance.
