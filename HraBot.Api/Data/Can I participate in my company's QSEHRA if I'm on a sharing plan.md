# Can I participate in my company's QSEHRA if I'm on a sharing plan?

It depends.

In general, sharing ministry plans do not qualify as Minimum Essential Coverage. [Read more about that here.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2274503-do-health-care-sharing-ministries-qualify-for-reimbursement-under-qsehra)

However, new rules have been proposed for 2021 and 2022 that allow sharing plan premiums to be reimbursed tax-free through QSEHRA as an eligible medical expense! You'll just have to also purchase a supplemental MEC plan in order to qualify for reimbursements.
