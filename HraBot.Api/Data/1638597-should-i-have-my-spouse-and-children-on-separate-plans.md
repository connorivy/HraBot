# Should I have my spouse and children on separate plans?

In most cases, being on the same plan as your spouse and children will be the simplest solution. However, if you have a family member with a chronic condition requiring specialty doctors, or specific long-term medications, you may be better off getting separate plans. Before you opt to add your spouse and children to your plan consider the following things:

- **Doctors and Specialists:** Are your spouse and children's doctors covered under your plan?
- **Medications:** Do you have a family member who requires specific chronic medications that might be more costly on one plan than another?
- **Savings:** Could you actually save money by choosing a different plan for your spouse and children?
- **Retired Public Education Employee?** If you are retired teacher, Teacher Retirement System (TRS) has health care coverage options available. It is often the best choice to use TRS for you, and move your family to a different plan due to the often high cost of adding family members to TRS insurance.
