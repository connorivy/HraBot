# How do I review my individual plan results and recommendations?

I went through onboarding in my member portal and see a list of individual plans available to me. Now what?

We know that the individual insurance market can be confusing. Our plan finder software takes the information you provide to help you research the plans available to you! We'll recommend a plan that we think will minimize your costs but have created an easy way for you to do your own research to help you make an informed decision about your own healthcare! Once you've completed the survey and see a list of your options, here's how to decipher what you see.

# Researching the Results

On the results page, you'll see a few details on each plan:

- **Deductible**: The amount of medical expenses that you pay before the insurance company kicks in with co-insurance. Premiums do not count towards the deductible.
- **Max Out-Of-Pocket**: The maximum amount that you could have to pay in a calendar year. This does not include monthly premiums, but does include deductible, co-insurance, and other out of pocket expenses.
- **Your Doctors**: How many of the doctors you entered into our doctor search (found under "Preferences" on the results page) are covered by this plan. Note that doctors can change what insurance they accept at any time. To be certain that your doctors will accept your insurance it's best to check with them directly.
- **Network Type**: The type of plan: HMO, PPO, or EPO. Need more information on what that means? See [here](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/health-insurance-101/insurance-terminology/hmos-and-ppos-and-epos-oh-my).
- **Metal Tier**: The primary difference between the different metal tiers is the percentage of costs that are covered by the plan. For a breakdown, [check out our help article that goes into more detail.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1638575-what-s-the-deal-with-the-metal-tiers)

- The maximum benefit payout, if applicable
- Which doctors are covered under the plan
- Whether the plan is HSA-eligible
- How much you'd pay out of pocket in the worst case scenario
- The cost of your doctor visits and prescriptions before & after your deductible is met
- How much an emergency hospital visit will cost

# Comparing Plans

You can select specific plans to compare by clicking on the "Compare" check box to the left of the premium amount on the results page. Once you've checked that box on more than one plan, you'll see a pop up with a button that allows you to compare those plans (you can choose up to 4 at a time).
