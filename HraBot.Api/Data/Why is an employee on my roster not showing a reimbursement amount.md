# Why is an employee on my roster not showing a reimbursement amount?

Why does my Reimbursement Statement or Employee Reimbursement Report show $0 in reimbursement for my employee?

---

## My Reimbursement Statement shows that my employee is owed $0.

If your [Reimbursement Statement](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3231141-how-do-i-read-my-reimbursement-statement) shows that an employee is not owed any reimbursements, it means that your employee has not submitted any claims in the date range that this statement is reflecting. There are a few instances where this may happen:

- Employee hasn't completed onboarding. You can check this by reviewing the [Employee Roster](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-roster). If their QSEHRA or ICHRA Status says "No Proof of Coverage," they have not yet completed onboarding. Or we have not yet reviewed what they submitted for onboarding, which generally takes 1-3 business days, but can take up to 30 business days.

- Employee hasn't yet submitted claims. Your employee may have submitted their proof of coverage for compliance purposes, but that doesn't automatically claim reimbursement for them. Double check to see if they have submitted any claims by clicking on their name in the [Employee Roster](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-roster). There you'll see a list of any claims that have been submitted.

- This month's claim already showed up in a Reimbursement Statement. Each Reimbursement Statement will show just how much each employee is owed since the last statement ran. For example, if your employee's premium is set up as a recurring claim, we'll create that claim on your employee's behalf on the 1st of the month. If you have had another Reimbursement Statement run this month, their premium claim is likely there.
