# How is my insurance cost determined?

Under the ACA, the only factors that can determine your insurance cost is your age, the number of people covered on the plan (and their ages), the State you live in, and tobacco usage. You cannot be charged more based on pre-existing conditions, gender, or race.

Also, it's important to note that it's illegal for anyone (including insurance brokers) to charge a higher price for a plan. That means the rate you see at Take Command Health is the same rate you'll see anywhere for that plan.
