# Will Take Command Health reimburse my employees?

No, Take Command Health will not reimburse your employees.

Employers handle the QSEHRA and ICHRA reimbursements directly with their employees.

Take Command Health's HRA platform will help you manage your QSEHRA or ICHRA by having your plan documents in place, keeping you compliant, track your employees' expenses, keeping notional accounting ledgers, and providing [Reimbursement Statements](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3231141-how-do-i-read-my-reimbursement-statement) so you know exactly how much to reimburse your employees.

When you set up your HRA, you can choose to have Reimbursement Statements automatically generated monthly, semi-monthly, or bi-weekly. You can also manually run a statement at any time through your member portal, but we recommend letting them run automatically.
