# Understanding the 'unreimbursed and outstanding' banner

Written by Support
Updated over a year ago

We understand that the 'unreimbursed' and 'outstanding' figures seen on your dashboard can be confusing and cause concern. We're happy to clarify this for you.

These numbers will reflect the total amount in claims that employees have submitted of which exceeds the amount that was reimbursable.

For example, if John's monthly insurance premium is $800, and his monthly allowance is $500, then you reimburse him the $500 - $300 will show up as 'unreimbursed' or outstanding.

These are not amounts that "should" have been reimbursed or anything - they are simply claims that exceed allowable reimbursement.
