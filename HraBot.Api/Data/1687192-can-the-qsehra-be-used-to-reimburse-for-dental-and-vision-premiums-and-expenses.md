# Can the QSEHRA be used to reimburse for dental and vision premiums and expenses?

## Do individual vision and dental plans qualify for QSEHRA?

Yes, dental and vision premiums and expenses can be reimbursed through a QSEHRA.

However, remember that an employee must have medical insurance that qualifies as [minimum essential coverage](https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/plans-that-count-as-coverage/) (MEC) in order to participate in the QSEHRA at all. As long as employees have MEC, whether it is with an individual plan through the marketplace or through a spouse's employer group plan, they can submit dental and vision insurance premiums for reimbursement as well. We just need proof of the MEC coverage in order to approve the reimbursements on other insurance plans.

Once proof of coverage is approved, then you can submit additional premiums (dental, vision) for reimbursement as a recurring premium claim!
