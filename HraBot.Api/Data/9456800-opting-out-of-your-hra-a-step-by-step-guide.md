# Opting Out of Your HRA: A Step-by-Step Guide

How to Waive Coverage for ICHRA or QSEHRA

If you're considering opting out of your company's health reimbursement arrangement, whether it's an Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) or a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA), here's what you need to know:

**Please note:** If you waive coverage through an ICHRA or QSEHRA and the ICHRA or QSEHRA is considered affordable, you may not claim the premium tax credit for yourself or any family members. If you do accept tax credits with an affordable HRA offering you may owe Tax penalties to the IRS.

## Do You Have Non-MEC Health Insurance?

- If your current health insurance does not qualify as Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) or you simply aren't interested in purchasing insurance (although we'd love to help you explore your options first!), you have the option to waive your coverage.

## How to Waive Coverage:

- Log in to your Take Command Health member portal.
- During the onboarding or re-enrollment flow, navigate to the second step on the "Reimbursement Amount" page.
- Click the option for not having a QLE and continue with "waive HRA for the year."
