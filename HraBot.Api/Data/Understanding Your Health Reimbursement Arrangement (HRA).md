# Understanding Your Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA)

## What is an HRA?

A Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) is an employer-funded plan that helps employees cover out-of-pocket medical expenses and health insurance premiums. Here's what you need to know about how HRAs work and the benefits they offer.

## Key Features of HRAs:

- **Employer-Funded:** Unlike other health accounts, HRAs are funded entirely by your employer. You do not need to contribute to these accounts.

- **Reimbursement Basis:** With an HRA, you pay for eligible healthcare expenses out-of-pocket such as medical insurance premiums, and then submit claims to get reimbursed from your HRA.

- **Tax Advantages:** Reimbursements from an HRA are typically tax-free, making your medical spending more efficient.

- **Eligible Expenses:** Common expenses that HRAs cover include:
  - Deductibles
  - Co-payments
  - Prescription medications
  - Other out-of-pocket medical expenses found on the FSA store: [FSAstore.com Eligibility List](https://fsastore.com/fsa-eligibility-list)

## Types of HRAs:

- **Individual Coverage HRA (ICHRA):** Reimburses for individual health insurance premiums and qualified health expenses.

- **Qualified Small Employer HRA (QSEHRA):** Available to small employers (fewer than 50 employees) to cover medical expenses and individual health insurance premiums.

## How HRAs Work:

- **Plan Design:** Your employer designs the HRA, deciding on eligible expenses, maximum reimbursement amounts, and whether unused funds will roll over each year.

- **Claims Process:** You pay for medical expenses and submit claims with receipts or other documentation to the HRA plan administrator.

- **Reimbursement:** The plan administrator reviews your claims and reimburses you for approved expenses up to the annual limit set by your employer.

## Advantages of HRAs:

- **Cost Control:** Employers manage healthcare costs by setting annual reimbursement limits.

- **Flexibility:** HRAs can be tailored to meet the specific needs of different workforces.

- **Tax Benefits:** Reimbursements are tax-free for you and tax-deductible for your employer.
  - Certain plans under QSEHRA are taxable.

## Considerations for Employees:

- **Documentation:** Keep and submit all receipts and documentation for your medical expenses to ensure reimbursement.

- **Plan Rules:** Understand the specific rules of your HRA, including what expenses are eligible and the process for submitting claims.

## Conclusion

HRAs offer a valuable benefit by helping you manage your healthcare costs. By understanding how your HRA works, you can make the most of this employer-provided resource to cover your medical expenses more effectively.
