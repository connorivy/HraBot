# Do I need to have a primary care physician?

It depends on your plan ([here's more information about the plan types](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1638614-hmos-and-ppos-and-epos-oh-my)). Most HMO or POS plans require a primary care physician (PCP), while PPO or EPS plans typically do not. A PCP is someone you go to first before you see a specialist.

If you are not sure who you want your PCP to be, you can let the insurance company assign one for you when you apply and change it later.
