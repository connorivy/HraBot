# I chose a different plan during Open Enrollment

Do I need to cancel my current plan?

# I chose a different plan during Open Enrollment that starts in January. Now what do I do?

Great question! If you are enrolling in a new insurance plan for the next year, after you complete your enrollment, call your current insurance provider and make sure to cancel your current plan by the end of the year.

# Why do I need to cancel my current plan?

### This is to prevent possible double charges in the new year. I wish to keep my current plan.

If you are keeping the same plan for the new year, you will need to renew your current plan. Depending on if your company offers AutoPay through Take Command there are two different ways to approach this.

- **No AutoPay**
  - You will need to renew your current plan with your insurance carrier directly and upload your coverage documents for the new year to your Take Command portal.
- **With AutoPay**
  - You will need to renew your current plan within the Take Command Portal. If there is an option to keep the same plan it will be listed as the first option on your shopping screen.
  - You will still need to complete the step above even if it is a self-enrolled plan directly through the carrier. This way you will be able to get the AutoPay banking details for 2025.
