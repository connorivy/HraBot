# How do I waive coverage through QSEHRA?

Do you have health insurance that does not qualify as MEC? Or, maybe you just aren't interested in purchasing insurance ([we'd love to help you explore your options before you make that choice!](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/welcome-to-take-command-health))?

Whatever your reasoning, if you are choosing NOT to participate in your company's QSEHRA plan, you can easily waive coverage through your Take Command Health member portal.

When walking through the onboarding or re-enrollment flow, on the Second step in the "Reimbursement Amount" page, click the option to skip forward and waive coverage for this year.

**Important Note:**

- If you waive coverage through a QSEHRA and it is considered affordable, you may owe back taxes to the IRS if you claim the premium tax credit for yourself or any family members.

If you decide mid-year that you do want to participate (for example, if your spouse loses their job through which you currently have insurance), it's not too late! Reach out and we can help you get set up for reimbursement.
