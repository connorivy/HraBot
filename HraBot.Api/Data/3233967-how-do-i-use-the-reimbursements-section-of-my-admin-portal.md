# How do I use the Reimbursements section of my Admin Portal?

When and how to use the Reimbursements section of the portal when you're ready reimburse your employees.

---

When you're ready to reimburse your employees, you'll want to reference your [Reimbursement Statements](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3231141-how-do-i-read-my-reimbursement-statement) in the [Reimbursements](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) section of your Member Portal. On these statements, we'll show you exactly how much each person is owed based on allowances & approved claims applied since the last report ran.

We recommend letting your statements run automatically each month or 2x per month. When you first signed up for your HRA, you selected the frequency and date for us to run the statements. However, you can always update that in the [Reimbursements](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) section of the portal, too.

Once you're in the Reimbursements section of the Admin Portal, you can view or [download your reimbursement statement](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3225696-how-do-i-download-my-reimbursement-statement), and use this as a guide for processing reimbursements.

Click on the date range for the reimbursement statement that you'd like to open, or click the three dots to the right to [download the Report as a CSV or PDF](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3225696-how-do-i-download-my-reimbursement-statement).
