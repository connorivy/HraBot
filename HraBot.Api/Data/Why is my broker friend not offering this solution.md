# Why is my broker friend not offering this solution?

The law is pretty new still, so we'll cut them some slack. Typically though, brokers like one-size-fits-all group plans because they're easier to sell—optimizing for each employee would be a time consuming headache. Our proprietary software makes optimization and support automatic and easy!

If they're interested, we love to work with brokers. Have them contact us or visit our [partners page](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/partners/brokers).
