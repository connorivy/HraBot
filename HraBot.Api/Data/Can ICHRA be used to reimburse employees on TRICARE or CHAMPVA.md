# Can ICHRA be used to reimburse employees on TRICARE or CHAMPVA?

Is Tricare an ICHRA eligible plan?

Unfortunately, no.

The guidelines for ICHRA are very clear that Tricare eligible employees will need to purchase a separate individual insurance plan to participate in ICHRA. While the guidelines didn't call out CHAMPVA specifically our understanding is that these employees will fall under the same guidance as Tricare eligible employees and need to purchase an individual plan to participate in ICHRA.
