# My doctor's information about what insurance plans he/she accepts is different than yours. Why?

Why does your website say my doctor accepts this plan, but they don't?

The Take Command Health Plan Finder is meant to help you cut down your research time & effort in order to find the plan that best fits your needs, including one that your doctors, who you trust with your care, accepts. In order to do that, we keep our data as up to date as possible and work hard to provide the information you need!

That said, doctors & medical facilities can change which insurance plans they accept at any time. To be certain that your doctors will accept your insurance it's always best to check with them directly!
