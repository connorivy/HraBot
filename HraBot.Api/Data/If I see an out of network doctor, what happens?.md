# If I see an out of network doctor, what happens?

It varies based on your plan. The general rule of thumb is that you will end up paying a lot more out of pocket when you go out of network. Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) tend to pay a portion, while many Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) pay nothing, and Exclusive Provider Organizations (EPOs) are somewhere in between. When possible, double check with your doctor, hospitals, and labs to make sure everyone is in network before any surgeries or lab work is completed to help save you money.
