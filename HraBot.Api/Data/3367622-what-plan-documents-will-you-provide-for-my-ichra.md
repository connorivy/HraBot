# What Plan Documents will you provide for my ICHRA?

When you sign up with Take Command Health, we will generate your plan and legal documents for you. You'll see the following documents:

Administrator Documents:

- **ICHRA Plan Document:** We have read the IRS rules and written the legal documents accordingly, so you don't have to! This is the legal document that establishes your ICHRA plan.
- **ICHRA Adoption Agreement:** This shows your specific company's ICHRA configuration selections, and it accompanies the ICHRA Plan Document.

Employee Documents:

- **Summary Plan Description:** This document is a detailed description of your company's ICHRA plan and will be available in your employees' member portals.
- **ICHRA Employee Notice:** We use this document, which is required by the IRS, to provide concise information about the ICHRA to your employees. This also has very important information that your employee needs to know about determining whether your ICHRA is "affordable" and therefore whether to accept tax credits. They'll need to provide specific information to the marketplace, and this notice provides all they need to know!
- **ICHRA Summary of Benefits and Coverage:** This one's a little tricky, because the document itself is designed to outline benefits provided by an insurance plan. The ICHRA is a reimbursement arrangement, not actual insurance coverage, but this document is still required and it outlines the ICHRA benefit in health insurance terms.
- **Employee Packet:** This one is meant to be a little more user-friendly than legal documents, and explains the ICHRA in more simple terms & answers some FAQs for your employees.

If you have any questions about the documents before approving, feel free to [e-mail](mailto://support@takecommandhealth.com) or chat with us online. When you're ready, be sure to approve the documents from your Member Portal.

Once the documents are approved, we will e-mail your employees to introduce the plan and have them complete their onboarding process. Double check that they are all included in your employee roster to make sure they get an invitation.
