# How do I get logged in to my Employee Member Portal for the first time?

I received an e-mail to login and complete onboarding for my company's HRA, but I haven't created a password yet.

You do not need to create an account - it's already been created for you! Your username is the e-mail address where you are receiving onboarding reminder e-mails from us.

If you don't know your password, have not yet set one, and/or your original sign-up link is expired, you can reset your password [here](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/password-reset). Please check your spam folder if you have not received an email within a few minutes.

If you still have not received the e-mail within a few minutes, you may be using an e-mail address that is not associated with your account. Double check to see where you are receiving our regular e-mails, and use that e-mail to reset the password. If you're still unsure, reach out to [support@takecommandhealth.com](mailto:support@takecommandhealth.com) and we can verify your username for you.
