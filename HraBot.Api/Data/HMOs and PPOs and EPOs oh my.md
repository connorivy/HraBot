# HMOs and PPOs and EPOs oh my!?

HMO, PPO, EPO, POS - what do these network types mean? It sounds confusing, but it mainly comes down to a few key points that distinguish these network types. Here's an overview:

![Network Types Comparison](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/50123194/7985ce28dec2179357c42572/encoded-image-1519763545.png)

## HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)

An HMO (or "health maintenance organization") is generally the most affordable, but least flexible network type. Here a few key concepts of a HMO:

- You are required to select a primary care physician (or the insurance company can assign one for you) who is your first-stop for health needs. You will need a referral from your primary care physician to see a specialist.
- If you choose to see a doctor outside of the network or without a referral, you will generally have to pay all costs out-of-pocket unless it is a true medical emergency or you have no other options.
- The physician network is local.

## PPO (Preferred Provider Organization)

A PPO (or "preferred provider organization") is generally the most flexible, yet most expensive network type. Here a few key concepts of a PPO:

- You do not need to select a primary care physician and you do not need referrals to see a specialist.
- If you see an in-network provider, you will only be responsible for paying a portion of the bill (based on your plan's coverage structure).
- If you choose to see a doctor who is outside the preferred network, you will generally have to pay a larger portion of the bill than you would for an in-network provider.
- You will have access to out-of-state providers that are considered in-network.

## EPO (Exclusive Provider Network)

An EPO (or "exclusive provider network") is a hybrid of a HMO and a PPO. Here a few key concepts of an EPO:

- EPOs are more flexible than an HMO, and are typically less expensive than a PPO.
- Like a PPO, you do not need a referral to get care from a specialist.
- Like an HMO, you are responsible for paying out-of-pocket if you seek care from a doctor outside your plan's network.

## POS (Point of Service)

A POS (or "point of service") is also a hybrid of a HMO and a PPO. Here are a few key concepts of a POS:

- POS plans are more flexible than an HMO, and are typically less expensive than a PPO.
- Like an HMO, you will need a referral from your primary care physician in order to see a specialist.
- Like a PPO plan, you will have access to out-of-network providers (at an increased cost).
