# How do I get a historical view of reimbursements owed & paid year-to-date?

How do I view my taxable and tax-free reimbursements for a range of time?

---

Are you looking for:

- A year-to-date summary of reimbursement types by employee?
- A monthly breakdown of your employees' reimbursements?
- An overall breakdown of Just last month's reimbursements?
- A combined summary for a given month, since you get more than one Reimbursement Statement in a given month?
- Some context for why exactly your Reimbursement Statement is showing the amount that is?

Good news! You can research more details on how your employees are using their allowance, and how we calculated their tax-free and taxable (if applicable) reimbursements.

The best way to get a historical view of reimbursements owed & paid year-to-date is in the Reimbursement Summary report in the [Reports](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reports) section of your member portal.
