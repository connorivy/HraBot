# Extra-Step Carrier: Instructions & Carrier List

For those who submitted health insurance applications for a plan with one of the "Extra Step" carriers, these applications require an additional action from the employee to make the initial binder payment and/or enable recurring payments for future months.

We sent an initial email with instructions on making these payments along with a following reminder with the information below:

If you haven't made either your binder payment or enabled recurring payments (sometimes called autopay or automatic payments), please make time to do that as soon as possible or your insurance coverage will be at risk for cancellation.

- Log into your member portal on your insurance company's website and locate payment settings.
- You may have to create a login if you are a new member. Contact the insurance company if you need help.

If your initial binder payment is paid (by you or Take Command) but you haven't enabled recurring payments (or don't remember if you did), please log into your insurance carrier's member portal and make sure those are enabled/turned on to make sure monthly payments aren't missed and your coverage isn't put at risk.

Where can you find your AutoPay payment details from Take Command to make your premium payments?

- [Log into your Take Command portal](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/). Payment details are viewed by clicking 'Settings' on the left side of screen, then 'Payment Information'.

2. Copy the payment details and enter them on your insurance company's site. Clicking the document icon allows you to copy the information. Clicking the eye icon will show you the digits. Protect this information. It is only authorized to make your premium payment. If requested, list your name as bank account owner. The account is checking and the bank name is "Trans Pecos Bank".

If you have questions or need help, please reach out to the Take Command Support team (214-866-7757).
