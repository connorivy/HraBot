# Admin's wanting to waive or Opt-out employees

Waiver instructions

This article is designed to assist administrators in helping their employees waive coverage. There are two ways for employees to correctly get marked as waiving coverage:

Below, we outline the actions employees and administrators can take to ensure the process is seamless and complies with all necessary requirements.

Additionally, administrators can manage employees more broadly by either waiving coverage or removing employees, both of which help ensure proper compliance and accurate billing.

- **Employees waive coverage themselves (recommended):**

  - [Here are instructions for QSEHRA](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/4658004-how-do-i-waive-coverage-through-qsehra).

- **Administrators waive for employees:** Although we strongly recommend encouraging your employees to log in and review the required plan documents, we know that is not always possible. If you want us to waive some of your employees manually, please send us the information via this [online waiver form](https://share.hsforms.com/1p1EYI5bgQVWtAFpfCpdKTw1i82f). You can provide names on a per-employee basis or upload a complete list of names using the spreadsheet template. You will be asked to attest that you provided the proper notices to your employees and provide a reason for why they are waiving coverage. Be sure to retain signed records for yourself that the employee elects to waive the benefit. Please note: to ensure you are not billed for employees who elect to waive their coverage on the upcoming invoice, the form must be submitted by the 24th of the month. The request can only be processed if the form is filled out in its entirety.

Employees must actively complete the waiver process through the provided steps in the portal. If no action is taken, coverage is not automatically waived.

This distinction ensures administrators understand when to guide employees to waive coverage and when to take broader actions involving employee removal.

**Admin Instructions:** To streamline the process, ensure that compliance and deadlines are respected.

- Double-check that all required fields and attestations are completed before submitting to avoid processing delays.

Please note that any waiver requests submitted after the 24th of the month will not be fully processed until the following month. Kindly keep this date in mind for billing purposes.

Additionally, administrators must ensure all necessary attestations and signed records confirming the voluntary nature of waivers are maintained for compliance.

Additionally, administrators are encouraged to familiarize themselves with best practices for compliance and maintain accurate records to avoid billing discrepancies.

If an employee waives coverage, there is no need to report disbursements for them; only enrolled employees require such reporting.
