# HRA Hub; User account creation - Employee

## Account Creation Process

**Invitation:** When you become eligible to shop, you receive an invitation email with a magic link. The magic link is active for 60-days.

**Sign-Up:** When you click your magic link, the account creation process begins.

You will be prompted to create a password that meets the following requirements:

- At least 12 characters
- A combination of upper and lower case letters
- At least one special character and one number

If the password doesn't meet these criteria, the system will provide guidance.

Once the password is created, you must complete [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://takecommandhealth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HHH/pages/671481862).

More info on [MFA here](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/9949462-multi-factor-authentication-mfa)

Currently, the supported methods are:

- Authenticator App
- Email
- SMS coming soon.

**Account Activated:** After completing the sign-up process and MFA, you now have a User Account. You can sign in to HRA Hub and use the Reset Password feature, if needed.

We highly recommend you bookmark the sign-in page for easy access.
