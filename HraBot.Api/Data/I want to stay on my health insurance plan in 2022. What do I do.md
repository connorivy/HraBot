# I want to stay on my health insurance plan in 2022. What do I do?

# I want to stay on my plan next year! Can I do that?

If you know your current plan will be offered next year and don't want to change, your carrier will automatically renew your plan with no action from you.

Many plans change from year to year, sometimes significantly, and we always encourage people to shop around to see what their full set of options are. In many cases, you may find that a better option is available due to the changing circumstances of the individual health insurance market. For example:

- It's not uncommon for plans to change networks. You'll want to double check that your doctors will continue to accept your plan next year!
- It's also common for monthly premiums to change. Check your premium for 2022 to make sure it's still the plan that makes the most sense for you.

If you aren't sure, or you want help looking into your options, we can help! [Schedule a time to talk to a member of our Enrollment Team](https://app.hubspot.com/meetings/emily445/phone-support), and we can talk through your options with you.**

If you do decide to stay on the same plan, check with your insurance carrier to ensure it's available next year and automatically renewing.

# I am sure I want to stay on the same plan! Now how do I update my 2022 HRA account with Take Command Health?

Even if you stay on the same plan, for compliance purposes, we ask for updated information each year. You'll still need to re-enroll in your company's HRA for 2022 and provide an updated proof of coverage for 2022 through your Take Command Health member portal.

When you login to your member portal during Open Enrollment, you'll automatically be placed into the re-enrollment flow. On the Reimbursement Amount page, click "Set up reimbursement for your existing plan."

We'll then ask you what type of plan you have, and then walk you through the onboarding flow, asking you to provide proof of your 2022 plan.

## Be sure that the document you provide shows your name, a 2022 date, and your 2022 premium!

Haven't received documentation for your 2022 plan? No worries, you can come back later once you get it! Just click "Exit and Save" in the bottom left hand corner, and you can go back and upload when you receive that proof of coverage from the insurance company. We'll enter you back into that 2022 onboarding flow every time you log back in.

**If you do decide to change plans, you'll need to cancel your 2021 plan directly with your insurance carrier.
