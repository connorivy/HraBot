# Why did you recommend these plans to me?

How do I know which plan is best?

Your priorities are our priorities—whether that means making sure specific doctors and prescriptions are covered or finding the most affordable plan, we use data and share personalized advice in plain language so you buy the coverage that's best for you. And, only you know what is best for you.

Based on the parameters you entered while you were going through our individual survey, our recommend plan is the one that is the best mix of the cheapest option and the one that covers the most of your doctors, prescriptions, etc.

Our recommendations are personalized and unbiased. We are here to help you navigate the process and make an informed decision to best fit your individual needs. We love health insurance so you don't have to!
