# What is UnitedHealth One Short-Term Insurance?

What is UHOne & how do their short-term plans work?

UnitedHealthcare's Short Term Plans offer a lot of flexibility to those looking for a short term solution. First consumers choose the term length - from 30 day minimum up to the state maximum. Then they choose a deductible and coinsurance amount that fits the budget. Note that it's only available in FL, GA, NC, PA, TN, TX, and WI and it will be 364 days in those states.

Enrollees have access to United Health Care's large network of doctors and hospitals. With UnitedHealthOne plans you must use a network doctor or hospital in order for insurance to pay for eligible expenses, only emergencies are allowed out of network.

**UHOne is different from traditional insurance in several ways:**

- Does not meet standards of Minimum Essential Coverage. This plan does not meet the standards of coverage required to participate in [QSEHRA](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/qsehra-guide).
- Excludes preexisting conditions
- Pregnancy not covered except for complications
- Plans do not last the entire year
- Enroll anytime- We recommend signing up for a duration that will allow you to utilize the next open enrollment period to sign up for a major medical plan (Nov 1- Dec 15 each year for plan starting Jan 1).

**How UH One is just like traditional insurance:**

- Prescription Coverage- pay for your prescriptions at the pharmacy and then submit a claim to UnitedHealthOne (max benefit $3,000)
- Copays& Coinsurance- $75 Urgent Care; office visits vary by plan from $50 copay to coinsurance after deductible.
- Maximum out-of-pocketfrom $2,000 to $10,000 per person (varies by plan)

**Good for those:**

- Waiting for the next open enrollment to begin
- Waiting for new coverage to start
- Are between jobs
- Retired early

**Note: short-term insurance plans do not qualify as Minimum Essential Coverage for QSEHRA.
