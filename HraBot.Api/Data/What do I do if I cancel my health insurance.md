# What do I do if I cancel my health insurance?

I canceled my health insurance plan- what should I do to update Take Command Health?

If you decided to cancel your health insurance policy with your insurance carrier and you are receiving HRA reimbursements, there are a few things you need to do to update your account with us.

If you no longer wish to receive any reimbursements or benefits through Take Command, there are additional steps you can take. The specific process will vary depending on whether you're switching coverage or opting out completely.

# Opting Out During Onboarding

If you haven't completed onboarding:

- Log in to your portal. You will automatically be directed to the onboarding process.
- On Step 2, select "waive" to opt out of the benefit. This will ensure you do not receive reimbursements for the current year. If onboarding is complete:
- Navigate to the Health Insurance tab.
- Click the Shop Insurance Plans button and use the waiver option to manually decline benefits.

1.) Cancel your recurring premium claim. You need to cancel your old recurring premium claim so that you won't receive reimbursements for it anymore! You can do this in your [member portal](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-view) under the "Reimbursements" tab under "Recurring Premiums." Just click the three dots to the right of the recurring premium claim you need to cancel and click "Cancel Recurring Expense."

For recurring medical premiums tied to proof of active coverage, submitting updated proof in the Add Monthly Premium section will replace existing proofs and halt the reimbursements.

2.) Upload a new proof of coverage. If you purchased new health insurance coverage, you'll need to update the proof of coverage we have on file for you. You can also do this in your member portal- [here's a help article explaining in more detail.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2284596-how-do-i-upload-an-updated-proof-of-coverage)

3.) Upload a new recurring premium claim. If you purchased new health insurance coverage, you'll also need to update your premium claim for your new monthly premium amount. [Here's a help article explaining how to do that.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2284649-how-do-i-set-up-my-monthly-premium-as-a-recurring-expense)

4.) Inform your administrator/employer. If you cancelled your health insurance because you don't want to participate in the HRA, you should let your employer know so they can take you off of the roster.

In addition, your employer can update your status to "waive" on their roster to stop reimbursements, or you can contact Take Command support to process the waiver if needed.

As always, if you have other questions, you can always chat with us using the circle in the bottom right- we're happy to help!
