# How do my employees know if their plan qualifies as Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)?

## Are my employees' health insurance plans qualified for QSEHRA reimbursements?

In order to qualify for your QSEHRA, your employees must have health insurance that qualifies as Minimum Essential Coverage. [In the IRS' comprehensive guidance for QSEHRA](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-17-67.pdf), page two addresses the need for MEC. Appendix A (page 57) outlines types of acceptable MEC. A [MEC plan](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/minimum-essential-coverage/) is an insurance plan that meets the Affordable Care Act requirement for having health coverage.

You may also see MEC plans referred to as "Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans" or "Obamacare health plans."

In summary, most group plans and full coverage individual health plans purchased through the marketplace qualify. The most common exceptions we see are short-term plans and coverage for only vision and dental plans. Also, see our [article about sharing plans](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/qsehra-faqs/qsehra-101/do-health-care-sharing-ministries-qualify-for-reimbursement-under-qsehra) (like Medi-Share), another type of plan we see often.

## What do Minimum Essential Coverage plans cover?

If a plan provide Minimum Essential Coverage, it means that it covers the following 10 Essential Health Benefits:

- Outpatient care—the kind you get without being admitted to a hospital
- Trips to the emergency room
- Treatment in the hospital for inpatient care
- Care before and after your baby is born
- Mental health and substance use disorder services: This includes behavioral health treatment, counseling, and psychotherapy
- Your prescription drugs
- Services and devices to help you recover if you are injured, or have a disability or chronic condition. This includes physical and occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, psychiatric rehabilitation, and more.
- Your lab tests
- Preventive services including [counseling, screenings, and vaccines to keep you healthy](https://www.healthcare.gov/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits) and care for managing a chronic disease.
