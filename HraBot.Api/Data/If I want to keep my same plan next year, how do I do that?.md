# If I want to keep my same plan next year, how do I do that?

Many plans change from year to year, sometimes significantly, and we always encourage people to shop around to see what their full set of options are. In many cases you may find that a better option is available due to the changing circumstances of the individual health insurance market.

However, if you know your current plan will be offered next year and don't want to change, your carrier will automatically renew your plan with no action from you.
