# Why is my employee's reimbursement missing from my Reimbursement Statement?

My reimbursement statement shows my employee is owed $0, but I expected to see a reimbursement for them. What's up?

There are a few reasons why your employee's claim may not be showing up on your employer's reimbursement statement. It's always a good idea for them to check their member portal to see if there is any information in there from our compliance team, as well! Here are a few things that may be happening:

- They have not yet uploaded proof of coverage. We need proof of their compliant health insurance coverage to approve their claims for reimbursement. They can upload proof of coverage in their member portal- [here's an article we wrote explaining how to do that](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2284596-how-do-i-upload-an-updated-proof-of-coverage).

- Their proof of coverage is noncompliant. The proof of health insurance coverage they submitted may show that their plans are not compliant with your HRA, or our compliance team may require some additional information to approve it. If this is the case, they'll see a note from our compliance team in their member portal about what else is needed or how to get it approved.

- Their proof of coverage is expired. If you requested for us to verify your employees' compliant coverage every quarter, their proof of coverage may need to be updated to show they are still covered under their health insurance plan before they can get reimbursed!

- They haven't uploaded any claims for reimbursement. To be reimbursed, they must upload a claim, and our compliance team must approve it. They can [upload a recurring premium claim](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2284649-how-do-i-set-up-my-monthly-premium-as-a-recurring-expense) or a [one-time medical expense](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2284624-how-do-i-submit-a-medical-expense-for-reimbursement) claim in their member portal.

- Their reimbursement claim was declined. If their reimbursement claim was declined by our compliance team, they can also see more information about why it was declined in their member portal! The claim won't show on your reimbursement statement until it's approved.

- If the claim was approved after your last reimbursement report ran/ generated, the claim will show on your next report!

If you've checked all of these and still are concerned about their reimbursement showing as $0 on your reimbursement statement, you can chat with us anytime and we'll be happy to look into it for you!

Additionally, if reporting errors are detected, we can regenerate the reimbursement statement to reflect updated amounts.
