# Can I participate in my company's ICHRA if I'm on TRICARE?

Is TRICARE a qualified health insurance plan with ICHRA?

Unfortunately, no.

The guidelines for ICHRA state that employees covered by TRICARE will need to purchase a separate individual insurance plan to participate in ICHRA. You can learn more about this in a blog post that addresses [TRICARE and ICHRA](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/tricare-and-ichra-).
