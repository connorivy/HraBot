# What is Open Enrollment?

Open Enrollment is an annual period when you can apply for health insurance. This is the one time each year that you don't need a "qualifying event" (like a marriage, move, or birth of a child) to change your health insurance plan. We always encourage people to take advantage of the Open Enrollment period by looking at all their options so you can find the plan that best meets your needs at the lowest cost.

Missing this window may result in the inability to secure health coverage for the entire plan year, making it crucial to review and make decisions during this time.

During Open Enrollment, employees will receive notifications via email that include instructions and deadlines for completing their health insurance selections. Employees are encouraged to log into their enrollment platform to review options, select plans, or upload necessary documentation to complete the process.

Open Enrollment runs from November 1st through December 15th in most states. That means that between November 1 & December 15, you can apply for coverage to start January 1. If you apply for a plan after Dec 15, you'll need a qualifying life event to qualify for "Special Enrollment."

Certain states may provide extended deadlines beyond December 15, with some allowing enrollments until January 15 for plans effective January 1. It is recommended to check state-specific guidelines for accurate deadlines.

Qualified life events can include marriage, birth of a child, loss of previous insurance coverage, or other significant changes that affect eligibility. Employees should refer to their plan details or consult with an advisor for more information.
