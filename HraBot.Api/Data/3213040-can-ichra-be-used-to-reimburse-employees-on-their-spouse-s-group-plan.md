# Can ICHRA be used to reimburse employees on their spouse's group plan?

Are employees eligible for ICHRA if insurance is through spouse's employer?

Unfortunately, no.

In order to participate in ICHRA, the insurance must be available on the individual market. If the spouse's plan is a group plan offered through the spouse's employer, the employee would **not be eligible** to participate in ICHRA because the plan is not secured from the individual market.

If employers with fewer than 50 employees are interested in reimbursing employees for medical expenses participating on a spouse group plan, [QSEHRA](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/qsehra-guide) is a good option.
