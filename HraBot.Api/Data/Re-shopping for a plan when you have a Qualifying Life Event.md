# Re-shopping for a plan when you have a Qualifying Life Event

This article details what to do if you previously had coverage, and then experienced a QLE and would like to re-shop.

If you experience a [Qualifying Life Event](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/9448810-what-is-a-qualified-life-event) after your initial policy has taken effect and wish to explore new options, you will need to cancel your current policy directly with your insurance carrier.

To start shopping for a new plan, visit your Take Command Portal, navigate to the Health Insurance tab, and select "Shop for Health Insurance."

- Please note that you will need to upload proof of your Qualifying Life Event. This documentation is necessary for us to provide to the carrier when submitting your application.

After confirming the cancellation of your existing policy, please contact Take Command support to inform us of the cancellation date.

Feel free to [contact support]() if you have any questions!
