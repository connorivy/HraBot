## Employee Enrollment Status

The enrollment status section provides administrators with a snapshot of all employees' enrollment stages, helping to identify those who may need assistance or follow-up. This feature is crucial for maintaining accurate records and ensuring all employees are appropriately covered.

### Accessing the enrollment status of employees

   - Once logged in, an Admin user is automatically dropped into the dashboard section of the admin portal.

   - You should see the Enrollment Status widget displayed, along with a "Download Report" button.
   - When you hover your mouse on the enrollment status widget, you will see more details on each enrollment category in detail, such as the status and the numbers below.
   - The formula used to calculate the percentage of completed enrollment is:
     - `% Completed = (Pending Invite + Invited + Onboarding + Waived + Opted-out + Active / Waived + Opted-out + Active) × 100`

### Employee Enrollment Categories
