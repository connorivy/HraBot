# Do I need to notify my current carrier if I change plans?

It depends. If your plan has been discontinued there is nothing for you to do. If your plan is continuing, we recommend that you cancel your current policy after your new policy has been confirmed. The easiest way to do this is to call the carrier and notify them that you're cancelling coverage. Unfortunately, Take Command Health is unable to do this on your behalf.
