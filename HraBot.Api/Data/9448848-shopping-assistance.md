We have an Enrollment team ready and available to assist you in selecting a plan. Please schedule a time with them here, on our [Enrollment Team Call Calendar](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/welcome-to-take-command-health#enrollment-call).

Once you click the link you will be able to select the 'Talk to a person' button of the screen.

From there it will prompt you to enter your company email address or the email address you will use to login to your Take Command portal.

Moving forward you will be able to confirm if you have been able to log into your Take Command portal. This is very important as you will not be able to schedule your Enrollment Call unless you have been able to successfully login to your portal.

After filling that portion out, you will be able to fill out your personal information, if there are any specifications you are looking for in a policy, if there are any doctors you would like to keep seeing, etc.

Please let us know if you have any further questions regarding Enrollment Support!
