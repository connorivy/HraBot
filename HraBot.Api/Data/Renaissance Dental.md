Get reimbursed for dental insurance with your HRA

## Introducing our new dental partner, Renaissance Dental

It's no secret that proper dental care is important and expensive. If you have an HRA through your employer, there's a silver lining beyond having a dazzling smile. Your dental insurance premiums can be reimbursed through your health reimbursement arrangement from your employer, either through a Qualified Small Employer HRA or an Individual Coverage HRA. Take Command has partnered with Renaissance Dental to roll out this new dental benefit on our platform. Here's the scoop.

We have partnered with [Renaissance Dental](https://www.myrencoverage.com/takecommand/) to allow our clients to offer their employees affordable dental insurance that can be reimbursed tax-free with their HRA.

Here's what their dental plans through Take Command offer:

- Affordable pricing. Single-member plans starting at $40 per month, with $50 individual deductible and $1,000 annual maximum.
- No waiting periods. Typically, there are 6-month waiting periods before a cavity can be filled, but with the Take Command offering through Renaissance Dental, waiting periods have been waived.
- 100% coverage for diagnostic and preventative services. No charge to you when you receive diagnostic, preventative service or annual cleaning from an in-network provider.
- Robust networks. Renaissance has an extensive footprint with more than 300,000 top quality providers across the country.
- No copays
- Great customer service!

## Is your dentist in network with Renaissance Dental?

Renaissance Dental has an extensive network of partner providers (300,000+ dental providers, in fact!). [Follow this link](https://www.myrencoverage.com/takecommand/) for a provider search tool to check if your favorite dentist is in network. Their provider search tool will be a better resource than calling your dentist and asking about Renaissance Dental.

Pro-tip: Take Command's plan with Renaissance Dental allows you to go to any dentist, but you'll save on out-of-pocket costs if you stick with in-network providers.

## HRAs and Dental Insurance

Your HRA can be used to reimburse for medical premiums, as well as premiums for dental and vision insurance. If your employer also reimburses for medical expenses, your leftover HRA dollars (after paying your premiums) can cover the costs that dental insurance does not, alleviating out-of-pocket costs.

## How to get set up with dental insurance

On the Take Command platform, when you're done shopping for medical insurance, you'll be prompted to select whether or not you want a dental plan. If you choose to, you'll be directed to Renaissance Dental's partner site. And remember, you'll only see this option to select a dental plan if your employer has selected to make it available.

Here's what it will look like:
