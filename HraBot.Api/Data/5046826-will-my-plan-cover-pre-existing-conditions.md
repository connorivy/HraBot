# Will my plan cover pre-existing conditions?

The short answer is... sometimes. It depends on what type of plan you choose!

If you purchase a major medical plan using our Shopping Tool in your member portal, any pre-existing conditions are required to be covered by the Affordable Care Act. You can read more about that [here.](https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/pre-existing-conditions/) You also cannot be charged more or rejected coverage due to a pre-existing condition.

Now, there are some plan types (not HRA-compliant) that do not cover pre-existing conditions, or have a tier system where you have to pay for the plan for a set amount of time in order for the condition to be covered. We do not sell these plans on our platform!

So, you can rest assured that if you shop through us, your health insurance plan will be 1) compliant with your fancy new HRA and 2) cover any pre-existing conditions you or your family may have.
