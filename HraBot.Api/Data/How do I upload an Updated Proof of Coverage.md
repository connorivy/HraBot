# How do I upload an Updated Proof of Coverage?

What can I upload, and where do I upload it?

To be eligible for reimbursements through your company's HRA, you must have qualified health insurance coverage.

- For QSEHRA, you must have coverage that qualifies as [Minimum Essential Coverage](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1690109-what-qualifies-as-minimum-essential-coverage-mec).
- For ICHRA, you must have [individual/family health insurance offered on or off the Exchange or Medicare](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3213072-what-type-of-plans-qualify-for-ichra).

To ensure your company's compliance with the HRA guidelines, there are 3 instances when we'll ask you to provide proof of your qualified health insurance plan:

- When you first onboard onto our platform to get started with your company's QSEHRA or ICHRA
- Each compliance period, either quarterly or annually.
- Anytime your coverage changes

What to provide:

[Here is a reminder of what documents you can submit as proof of coverage.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/managing-my-qsehra/qsehra-onboarding/what-is-proof-of-coverage) In order to be compliant, we will need to see a document or combination of documents with all of the following information:

- Your name - (the name of the HRA-eligible person -- regardless of if you are the primary insured or a dependent)
- The premium amount - (if you are claiming it for reimbursement)
- A current date - (a document dated within the last 30 days is considered current for compliance purposes)
- The name of the plan + provider - (i.e.: Gold/Silver/Bronze 1234 with Insurance Company's logo)

While it is our preference to have all of the above information on one document, we realize that is not always possible. Multiple documents are acceptable as long at the combination of documents provides all the above information we are asking for.

## Where & How to Upload a New Proof of Coverage
