# Can I be denied coverage for pre-existing condition?

No. As of January 1, 2014 all major medical individual plans must cover pre-existing conditions. If you are purchasing a plan on or off the exchange during Open Enrollment, or with a Qualifying Event during Special Enrollment, you can no longer be denied coverage or charged more due to pre-existing conditions.

There are many kinds of alternative health insurance plans available that do exclude pre-existing conditions. But we're here to help!
