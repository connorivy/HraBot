## Overview

## Activity Feed

The Activity Feed is a powerful financial management tool designed to give administrators a clear, real-time view of debits and credits across different accounts within their company. It facilitates effective monitoring between their payment, disbursement, and employee sub-accounts.

### Accessing the Activity Feed

### Access bank statements

A modal will appear to select the account and statement date to download the report.

The statement will download following the browser's process in the selected date range.

## Funding Reports

Funding reports track and report on the movement of funds from the external payment account to the disbursement account. Its primary purpose is to offer a clear and detailed overview of debit transactions, ensuring that administrators and financial stakeholders have a comprehensive understanding of the flow of funds between these crucial accounts.

**Note:** Funding reports are based on the date Take Command initiates a debit for the employee (via a funding event).

### Accessing the Funding Report

1. As an company administrator once you are logged into the company portal, select AutoPay from the navigation pane.
2. Once the page loads, you should be on the 'Activity' tab. Then click on the 'Funding Report' tab to the right of the 'Activity' tab.

The Funding Report page appears, and you will have the ability to select the month and year for which Funding Report they would like to download. Each record shows the month, time range and amount for the funding event, and a download button.

Once the month and year are selected, then a list of employees will be displayed. It's important to note the withdrawal date and recurring premium amount as that can denote the funding event type (Open Enrollment vs. regular monthly funding) for the employee. The admin will have the ability to select all or individually select which employees they would like to see in the CSV. Then in the CSV you can filter based on your needs.

## Autopay Settings

For a company administrator, they can have quick access to their Autopay settings from their company's autopay section. The 'Autopay Settings' grants visibility into the payment account that is connected with the disbursement account.

### Accessing the AutoPay settings page from the AutoPay main page
