# How do I read my Claims Summary report?

Learn more about what insight the Claims Summary report provides.

---

The [Claims Summary report](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reports) provides you with a year-to-date summary of each employee's allowances, claims, reimbursements, and accumulated unclaimed allowance. You can click on the numbers in the Offered, Claims, and Reimbursements fields for a monthly breakdown.

## Let's walk through each of the column headings:

Offered: Here you can see your employee's HRA allowance broken down by month. Remember that any unclaimed reimbursement allowance in a given month rolls over to the next month and accumulates throughout the year. We apply allowances to each employee on the 1st of the month.

Claims: These are your employees' approved claims year-to-date. The "Reimbursed" column represents how much of each claim has been on a [Reimbursement Statement.](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) If the full amount of the claim isn't what is shown in the reimbursed column, it means that the employee has [used up their allowance year-to-date.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3225177-why-does-my-employee-s-claim-show-it-s-partially-or-not-reimbursed)

Reimbursements: This shows employee reimbursement amounts broken down by month. These amounts will correspond with your reimbursement statements run in each month, and are up to date as of the last [Reimbursement Statement](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3231141-how-do-i-read-my-reimbursement-statement) date. There are separate line items for tax-free & taxable reimbursements, so you may see two lines for the same month. If you have not yet run a [Reimbursement Statement](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/hra/reimbursement-statements) or processed reimbursements for the current month, you won't see any current month reimbursements here.

Unclaimed Allowance: This shows your employee's unclaimed allowance year-to-date. [Read more about that here.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2480711-what-is-my-unclaimed-allowance)
