# HRA Hub; Submitting Proof of Coverage (POC)

Your employer can reimburse you up to the amount of your allowance each month. If you do not want to use your Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) allowance for this premium, simply enter $0 in the premium amount field.

**Monthly Health Insurance Premium Entry:**

- **Who is covered?** Select any of the dependents that is covered under this plan
- **Premium Amount:** Enter the monthly health insurance premium amount.
- **Start Date:** Enter the start date of your plan. The start date of the coverage can be in the past, even for the prior year if submitting claims in Q1 of the current year. Employees have until March 31 to submit claims for premiums from the prior year. A start date for a recurring premium can typically be any day of the month, but this depends on the policy of the insurer or the terms of the service. In many cases, recurring premiums are set to start on a specific day, such as the first or 15th of the month, to simplify billing cycles. However, some insurers or platforms may allow the start date to align with the policy's effective date, which could fall on any day of the month.
- **End Date:** Enter the end date of your plan based on the compliance schedule outlined above.

## Tax Credits

**Interaction with the HRAs Take Command Administers ICHRAs, QSEHRAs, and PTCs:**

- **Affordable ICHRA** – Tax credits cannot be accepted for an employee (or their dependents) if the employee is offered an affordable ICHRA, regardless of whether or not the employee chooses to participate in the ICHRA.
- **Unaffordable ICHRA** – Tax credits can be accepted instead of utilizing the HRA offer if an employee is offered an unaffordable ICHRA. The employee would opt out of the ICHRA in this case, and enroll through the marketplace
- **Affordable QSEHRA** – Tax credits cannot be accepted by an employee (or their dependents) if the employee is offered an affordable QSEHRA, regardless of whether or not the employee choose to participate in the QSEHRA.
- **Unaffordable QSEHRA** – Tax credits can be accepted, however they must be offset by any the amount offered through the QSEHRA. For example: If an employee is offered $300 allowance with a QSEHRA, but is eligible for $500 in tax credits, they may accept $200 in tax credits only.

The determination of HRA affordability is vital, influencing tax credit eligibility and usage. Tax credits for health insurance are typically applied through plans purchased via a Health Insurance Marketplace or similar exchanges, where eligibility for credits is determined based on income and other factors.
