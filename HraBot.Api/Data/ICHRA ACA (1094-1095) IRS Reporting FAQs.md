Q: Do I need to fill out Part 3 on a 1095-B form?

A: No, you don't. If any employees had coverage, they'll receive that information directly from their insurance carrier. Just make sure to fill out Part 2 with your company's information!

Q: If I'm not an ALE and an employee decided to waive coverage/not participate in the ICHRA, do I need to file a 1095-B for them?

A: No, we do not believe you should need to file a 1095-B for those employees. This is based on our interpretation of the guidelines though, so please check with your CPA as well.
