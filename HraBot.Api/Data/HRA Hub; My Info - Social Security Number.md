# HRA Hub; My Info - Social Security Number

This article guides you on social security number needs and requirements.

## Why is my SSN needed?

Your Social Security Number (SSN) is required when submitting your carrier application for several reasons:

- **Identification**: Your SSN is a unique identifier that helps verify your identity accurately. It ensures that the carrier can match your application with your personal records.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Many insurance carriers are required by law to collect SSNs to comply with regulations related to the administration and processing of insurance applications.

- **Verification of Eligibility**: The carrier may use your SSN to verify your eligibility for coverage, including checking your eligibility for certain plans or benefits.

- **Billing and Claims Processing**: Your SSN may be used for billing purposes and to process claims efficiently. It helps ensure that your insurance benefits are applied correctly and that claims are processed accurately.

- **Preventing Fraud**: Collecting SSNs helps insurance carriers prevent fraud by confirming that the applicant is who they claim to be and by detecting any potential inconsistencies or discrepancies in the application information.

It's important to note that insurance carriers have strict privacy and security measures in place to protect your personal information, including your SSN.

## Rules:

- Enter 9-digit numbers, without dashes, for each individual selected for the health plan.

- SSN can start with 0 or 00, but not with 000-00-0000 or a sequence of all zeros, ones, or threes.

- For privacy, the SSN display defaults to hidden. You can toggle this option as needed.

- SSN must be unique per person. An error message will be displayed if duplicate SSNs are entered.

- The Continue button will be disabled until all input fields, including SSN, are valid.

## Ensuring Data Integrity:

- SSN is NOT cached to maintain data security.

- If a preferred name is available, it will be displayed. Otherwise, the full name (First, Last) will be shown.

With these guidelines, you can confidently provide the necessary SSN information for purchasing your health plan, ensuring data accuracy and security throughout the process.
