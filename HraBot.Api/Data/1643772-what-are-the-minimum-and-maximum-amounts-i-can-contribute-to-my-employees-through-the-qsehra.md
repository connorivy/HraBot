Reimbursement Amounts

## What's the maximum amount I can contribute to my employees through the QSEHRA?

The 2025 QSEHRA allowance maximums are:

$6,350 ($529.16/ month) for single employees and $12,800 ($1066.66 / month) for families. These amounts will go up each year with inflation.

## Is there a minimum I have to contribute?

Nope! We typically recommend at least 50% of a Bronze plan premium, but it's totally up to you. Our design experts are available to help you figure out what your employees can buy at certain rates.
