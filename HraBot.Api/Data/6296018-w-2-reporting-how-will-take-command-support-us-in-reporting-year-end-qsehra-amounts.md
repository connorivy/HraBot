# W-2 Reporting: How will Take Command support us in reporting year end QSEHRA amounts?

Where to find a year end data file to help with W-2 reporting

**End of Year Support from Take Command Health**
Take Command Health will send you an annual report in mid-December that lists your eligible employees and the amounts that should be reported on their W-2 Forms, according to our records. It's up to the QSEHRA plan administrator (you) to make sure that the eligible employee list and amounts are complete and correct. Of course, we're here to help!

**Where can I find the report and instructions?**

Administrators on the Take Command platform can find their QSEHRA year end report within the Documents section of the admin portal during the week of 12/20/2024. The report is named "2024 W-2 Report - <company name>" see screenshot below.

**How can I receive additional help?**

While we're insurance experts, we are not CPAs or tax professionals, so we definitely recommend running any questions by yours before making any big decisions or filing forms!
