# Can I provide benefits for my nanny or household employee with an HRA?

I have a nanny or household employee- can I use a HRA to provide health benefits?

Yes- absolutely!

An HRA can be a great option for providing benefits for household employees, like nannies. Your employees can either start getting reimbursed for coverage they already have, or purchase new coverage and get reimbursed for it! The best part is, you (the employer) get to choose how much you want to spend on benefits, and your costs will never exceed that amount!
