# How do I reset my password?

I am trying to reset my password but I haven't received the e-mail yet.

You can reset your password anytime by [following this link](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/password-reset). Please check your spam folder if you have not received an email within a few minutes.

If you still have not received the e-mail within a few minutes, you may be using an e-mail address that is not associated with your account. Double check to see where you are receiving our regular e-mails, and use that e-mail to reset the password. If you're still unsure, reach out to [support@takecommandhealth.com](mailto:support@takecommandhealth.com) or chat with us in the bottom right hand corner, and we can verify your username for you.
