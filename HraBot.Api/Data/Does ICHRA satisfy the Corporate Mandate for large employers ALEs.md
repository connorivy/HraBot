# Does ICHRA satisfy the Corporate Mandate for large employers ALEs?

Does ICHRA meet the employer mandate?

Yes, ICHRA can satisfy the corporate mandate for large employers (ALEs) if the offer is "affordable". ICHRA is deemed affordable if the amount an employee has to pay for self-only coverage (lowest cost silver plan on exchange) is less than 8.39% (rate for 2024) of employee's household income.

See IRS Notice [2023-29](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-23-29.pdf) that provides the applicable percentage table.
