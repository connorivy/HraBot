### Key Features:

- **Add, Edit, or Delete**: Users can add, edit, or delete family members they wish to include in their health plan coverage. Spouses and dependents are added individually.

- **Employee Card Tags**: The employee card contains essential tags such as Date of Birth (DOB), Name, Employee/Family Member Type, ZIP Code - County, Doctor, Hospital, and Prescriptions. Users can edit and delete family members but cannot remove their employee card.

- **Age and Dependency Criteria**: If a dependent is over the age of 26, no plans will appear, as they are no longer eligible for coverage under most plans. Similarly, if there is a disabled dependent over 26, they will not be included in the plan selection process.

- **Family Members**: If the employee has Medicare, Medicaid, or a family member residing in a different ZIP code, the platform will display a warning message. This message alerts the employee to additional considerations when selecting and purchasing health insurance plans.
