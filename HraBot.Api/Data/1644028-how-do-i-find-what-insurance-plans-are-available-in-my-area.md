# How do I find what insurance plans are available in my area?

We can help you find plans available for you in your zip code.

The best place to get started finding the plan that is right for you is by logging into your [employee member portal here](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-view).

We'll walk you through the onboarding steps, which includes finding a health insurance plan. You can discover all your options and search for plans with your doctors and prescriptions. You will be able to compare all plan options in order to choose the plan that best fits your needs.

Our system will help you see which plans are accepted by your doctors. However, it's important to note that if you are concerned whether your doctor or hospital will accept the plan, you can always give them a call directly for the most accurate information.
