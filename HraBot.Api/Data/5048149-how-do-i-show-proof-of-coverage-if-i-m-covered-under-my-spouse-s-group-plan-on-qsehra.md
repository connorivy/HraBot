# How do I show proof of coverage if I'm covered under my spouse's group plan on QSEHRA?

Proof of coverage for spouse group plans

A spouse group plan is health insurance coverage provided through your spouse's employer. It can often be more cost-effective than obtaining an individual plan. Some companies offer reimbursements for the premiums you pay to be covered under your spouse's plan.

## Importance of Reimbursement

Reimbursements help offset the cost of health insurance and save you money. To determine if your company offers this benefit, you can:

- Ask your company directly how your HRA
- Check the documents provided in your Take Command account.
- [Contact our support team](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/9451119-contact-us) for assistance.

## Tax Implications

Reimbursements can be pre-tax or post-tax, affecting their taxability. Pre-tax reimbursements are not taxed, whereas post-tax reimbursements are. This distinction is crucial for understanding your net savings.

## Required Documentation

To get reimbursed, you need to provide documents that show:

- Recent Proof of Coverage: A document dated within the past 30 days confirming your coverage.
- Dependent Status: Proof that you are a covered dependent.
- Premium Details: If your company reimburses premiums, include a recent paystub showing the premium deduction.
- Carrier and Plan Name: Documents like a summary of benefits or official letters that show this information.

## Acceptable Documents

The types of documents you can submit include:

- Summary of benefits election form.
- Letter from HR.
- Letter of eligibility from the insurance carrier.
- Insurance ID card (to prove coverage but not premium payments).
- Recent paystub (showing premium deduction).

You may need to submit a combination of these documents to provide all the necessary information.

## Submission Process

- Ensure Documents are Recent: They should be dated within the past 30 days.
- Confirm Coverage and Premium: Use a combination of documents if needed to show both coverage and premium payment.
- Automatic Claims: Once set up, your reimbursement can be processed automatically each month if your documentation supports a recurring claim.

## Steps to Take

- Check with Your Company: Verify if your employer offers spouse group plan reimbursements.
- Gather Documentation: Collect the necessary documents.
- Submit Proof: Upload the required documents through the appropriate channels, such as your benefits portal, or by [contacting support](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/9451119-contact-us).

## Maximizing Your Benefits

Understanding and following the process for getting reimbursed for your spouse's group plan can be straightforward. Always confirm specific requirements with your HR department or benefits administrator and utilize available resources effectively to maximize your savings.
