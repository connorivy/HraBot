# Can I get reimbursed for medical expenses if I don't have health insurance?

Can I still get reimbursed if I don't have insurance?

No. To be reimbursed for eligible medical expenses through your HRA, you must have compliant health coverage. Compliant coverage looks a little different for each HRA!

**For QSEHRA:** you must have insurance that meets the standards of Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) in order to qualify and be reimbursed. [You can read more about that here!](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1690109-what-qualifies-as-minimum-essential-coverage-mec)

**For ICHRA:** you must have an individual major medical insurance plan purchased on or off the Exchange (bronze, silver, or gold plans) or Medicare in order to qualify and be reimbursed.
