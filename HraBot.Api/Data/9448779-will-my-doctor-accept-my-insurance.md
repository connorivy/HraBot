# Will My Doctor Accept My Insurance?

Through the Take Command Health Plan Finder, you can enter your doctors into our system, and we'll tell you which plans have your doctor in-network.

When you get to the results page in your member portal that shows the available plans in your area, click "Preferences" in the top right corner. You can then add your doctor's name into the search field and click "Refresh Plans" to see the results.

Then, when you look at the results page, on each plan, you'll see a summary of how many of the doctors you entered are covered by the plan:

**Note that doctors can change what insurance they accept at any time. To be certain that your doctors will accept your insurance it's best to check with them directly.**
