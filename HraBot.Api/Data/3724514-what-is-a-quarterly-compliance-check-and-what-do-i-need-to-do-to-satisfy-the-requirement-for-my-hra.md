## This article is about Quarterly Compliance checks.

As part of your company's HRA, Take Command provides compliance support to ensure that every participant is maintaining eligible health coverage throughout the plan year. If your HRA is set up for quarterly compliance checks, this means we'll verify each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1) that your health insurance is still active.

# What do I have to do?

We'll send lots of reminders, but each quarter you'll need to provide an updated proof of coverage document, using this link in your [Dashboard](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-view):

# What documentation should I provide as updated proof of coverage for a compliance check?

For quarterly compliance checks, with most insurance types, we're looking for documentation that shows your name (the name of the HRA-Eligible employee), your insurance company name and/or plan name, monthly premium amount, and a date **within the last 30 days**. Examples include: a monthly bill from your insurance provider, a screenshot from your health insurance online portal that shows when your next bill is due, or a dated screenshot from your health insurance online portal that shows your coverage is current.

If your recurring premium is set up for the current year already, you do not need to do that again.

Here is a little more information about what to provide as proof of coverage based on your insurance plan type.

- **Individual Insurance Plan:** A monthly bill from your insurance provider dated within the last 30 days. Or, you can provide confirmation of your most recent premium payment, including a bank statement or credit card statement, payment confirmation e-mail, or screenshot from your insurance member portal.

- **Spouse's employer group plan (QSEHRA Only):** Your spouse's most recent pay stub, or a screenshot from your insurance member portal showing your name and a current date.

- **Medicaid, TRICARE, Medicare or your parents' insurance (QSEHRA Only):** Your ID card or other document showing your name and enrollment in the plan. For Medicare, your red, white, and blue ID card is perfect!

- **MEC Plans (QSEHRA Only):** A monthly bill from your MEC insurance provider dated within the last 30 days. Or, you can provide confirmation of your most recent premium payment, including a bank statement or credit card statement, payment confirmation e-mail, or screenshot from your insurance member portal.

- **Sharing Plans (QSEHRA Only):** See MEC Plans above. For a sharing plan to be eligible for reimbursement, it must have a plan that meets Minimum Essential Coverage alongside it. For quarterly compliance, if you are on a sharing plan, we only need to see your MEC plan dated within the last 30 days.
