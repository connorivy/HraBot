# HRA Hub; Waiving Your HRA

This article guides employees through waiving their participation in their HRA.

For employees who do not want to participate in their employer's HRA offer, we have 3 distinct ways to waive.

## How to Waive Coverage

1. Log into the portal.
2. Proceed to your preferred waive method
   - **Option 1**: If enrolled in Medicaid.
   - **Option 2**: By entering household income or not wanting to take tax credits
   - **Option 3**: Direct waiver without selecting a plan.
3. **Follow Prompts**: Complete the waiver process by following the on-screen instructions. During the waive process, you will have the opportunity to share the reason for your decision if you choose to do so. This helps us understand your needs better and improve our services.

## Option 1: Waive Due to Medicaid Enrollment

If you are currently enrolled in Medicaid, you will be automatically directed to the waive questions. Here's why:

- **Eligibility**: Medicaid enrollees are not eligible to participate in a Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) because Medicaid is not considered individual health insurance. Therefore, it does not qualify as a participating plan for the Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) benefit.
- **Waive Process**: You will be presented with a popup modal or a waive link, allowing you to opt-out of the HRA offering provided by your employer.

## Option 2: Waive by Entering Household Income

As an employee, you can choose to waive shopping for a health plan by providing your household income information. Here's how it works:

- **Income Entry**: You will be prompted to enter your household income details.
- **Waive Option**: If, based on your income, you decide not to participate in the health plan, you can waive your coverage accordingly.

## Option 3: Waive Shopping Completely

If you simply do not want to select a health insurance plan, you can opt to waive shopping altogether. This option is straightforward:

- **Direct Waive**: You can choose to waive the shopping process without providing additional information or reasons.
