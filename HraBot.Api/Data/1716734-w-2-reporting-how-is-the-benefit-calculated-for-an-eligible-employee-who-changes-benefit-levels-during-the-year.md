# W-2 Reporting: How is the benefit calculated for an eligible employee who changes benefit levels during the year?

What if the employee's coverage changed from single to family?

The amount reported on the W-2 will be prorated to reflect the change the employee made during the year.

**Example**: Employer provides a QSEHRA with a self-only permitted benefit of $3,960 and a family permitted benefit of $8,040. John Employee enrolls in self-only coverage from January 1 through July 31 and in family coverage from August 1 to December 31.

On the W-2, the employer reports a permitted benefit of $5,660 (($3,960 x 7/12) + ($8,040 x 5/12)).
