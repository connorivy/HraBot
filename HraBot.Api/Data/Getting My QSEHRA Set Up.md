Wondering where to start?

1. **Pick a start date.** The first step is pretty easy-establish a start date! If your company currently does not offer a group plan, you can start your plan ASAP. However, if you already have a plan in place you will need to cancel it before you begin your QSEHRA.

2. **Set a cancellation date for your group policy.** This step is only for business owners currently offering group health insurance. You will need to cancel the group plan coverage before the start date of the new QSEHRA. In order to avoid any gaps in coverage, ensure the group plan ends one day before the QSEHRA begins.

3. **Confirm who will be eligible.** You are required to offer the QSEHRA to all full-time employees. You have the option to offer the QSEHRA to part-time employees as well, but it is not required.

4. **Determine a budget and set allowances.** Your next step is to determine how much you'll give employees to reimburse them for premium costs and medical expenses. You can set a monthly allowance or offer the The 2025 QSEHRA allowance maximums are: $6,350 ($529.16/ month) for single employees and $12,800 ($1066.66 / month) for families.. There is no minimum contribution amount to participate in a QSEHRA.

5. **Establish legal plan documents.** We will actually handle this step for you! You will just have to approve the documents we create. The IRS and Department of Labor have a variety of rules to follow regarding QSEHRAs. Failure to comply with the rules will result in penalties. Your legal plan documents must include the QSEHRA policies including monthly reimbursement amounts and reimbursement eligibility.
