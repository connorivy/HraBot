# Do I have to give my employees the required Employee Notice 90 days before my QSEHRA even begins?

No. You can provide the Employee Notice to your employees the day your QSEHRA begins.

## What is the Employee Notice?

As part of the required plan documents to establish your QSEHRA, the IRS requires that you provide a notice to your employees of the plan. QSEHRA was established through the 21st Century Cures Act, which requires in Section 9831(d)(4) that "an eligible employer who provides a QSEHRA to its eligible employees must furnish a written notice of the plan to each eligible employee at least 90 days before the beginning of each year or, for an employee who is not eligible to participate at the beginning of the year, the date on which the employee is first eligible to participate in the QSEHRA."

## So what does that mean?

The employee notice must be furnished 90 days before the before a new plan year begins for any employee that is already currently enrolled in the QSEHRA.

In the case of a newly eligible employee, the initial written notice must be furnished on or before the first day they become eligible. This applies to all employees when your QSEHRA first takes effect, since your employees are newly eligible on the first day of your QSEHRA. This also applies to any new employees you hire. For reference, [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-17-67.pdf) is the IRS guidance - see Question 37, which addresses this specifically.

When your new QSEHRA first becomes effective, all of your employees are newly eligible. Therefore, providing them with the notice on or before the day they the QSEHRA begins, which is the day they become eligible, satisfies the IRS requirement.
