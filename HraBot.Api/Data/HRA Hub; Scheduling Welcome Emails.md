## Setting the Email Notification Date

As an admin, you can set the email notification date to ensure employees are informed about their enrollment period. Here's how it works:

- **Determine the Plan Start Date:** The plan start date is crucial as it sets the timeline for the enrollment period. For example, if the plan start date is July 1, 2024, the enrollment period begins on May 1, 2024, which is 60 days prior.

- **Select an Email Notification Date:**
  - You can choose a date to send out emails any time in the month prior to the enrollment period start or during the enrollment period.
  - For example, if the plan start date is July 1, 2024, you can set the email notification date between June 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024.

- **Minimum Notification Period:**
  - To ensure employees have enough time to review and select their benefits, you must choose an email notification date that is at least 15 days before the eligibility date.
  - If you are setting up the roster within 15 days of the eligibility date, the system will automatically send out emails on a predefined schedule (e.g., immediately, the next day).

- **Best Practices:**
  - Ideally, set the email notification date 45 days before the eligibility date. This gives employees ample time to consider their options.
  - At a minimum, employees should receive the email 30 days before the eligibility date.
  - Consider making the notification period a configurable setting, allowing flexibility to adjust the timing as needed.

## Example Scenario

Let's walk through an example to clarify:

- Plan Start Date: July 1, 2024
- Eligibility Date: July 1, 2024
- Enrollment Period Start: May 1, 2024 (60 days before the eligibility date)
- Email Notification Date Options: Any date between May 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024.
- Minimum Notification Date: June 15, 2024 (15 days before July 1, 2024)

If you choose to send out emails on June 7, 2024, this provides 23 days before the eligibility date, giving employees ample time to review and enroll in their benefits.
