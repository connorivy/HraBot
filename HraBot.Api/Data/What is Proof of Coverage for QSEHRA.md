# What is Proof of Coverage for QSEHRA?

This article will outline what to provide as proof of coverage based on your insurance plan type.

### Individual Insurance Plan (Gold/Silver/Bronze major medical plan):

A monthly bill from your insurance provider, a screenshot of the confirmation page from your enrollment, an e-mail confirmation of your enrollment, your healthcare.gov confirmation page, or even a screenshot from your health insurance online portal will usually do the trick for proof of coverage. If you are claiming the premium for reimbursement, then we would also need to see how much you pay monthly toward that premium.

Ultimately, we're looking for a document (or a combination of documents) that shows ALL of the following:

- Your name - (the name of the HRA-eligible person - If you are not the primary insured then we will need to see that you are a covered dependent.)
- The premium amount - (if you are claiming it for reimbursement.)
- A current date - (a document dated within the last 30 days is considered current for compliance purposes.)
- The name of the plan + provider (i.e.: Gold/Silver/Bronze 1234 with Insurance Companies logo)

### Medicare:

Your red, white, & blue Medicare ID card will show us you're enrolled! To claim reimbursement for your Medicare premiums, you can provide monthly invoices, your SS benefits statement, your annual Medicare letter, or proof of your Medicare premium payments.

While you can combine all your Medicare premiums into one reimbursement request, if you have any premiums that end on different dates, then they would need to be separate submissions.

### Employer group plan (through a spouse or another employer):

Usually, a benefits election form, a letter from the employer providing the benefits, or a screenshot from your insurance provider's online portal, will do the trick. Ultimately, we're looking for a document (or a combination of documents) that shows ALL the following:

- Your name
- The plan name
- Confirmation this coverage is in place for 2023 specifically
- The premium amount, if you are claiming reimbursement for your premium

### COBRA

A recent bill or statement, your COBRA election form, a screenshot from your insurance provider's online portal, COBRA payment coupons, or proof of recent payment will work great. Ultimately, we're looking for a document (or a combination of documents) that shows ALL of the following:

- Your name
- The plan name
- A recent transaction date (within 30 days) that shows us this coverage is currently in place for current year specifically

### TRICARE

You can provide a letter of eligibility from the Department of Defense or the insurance company, or you can provide your military ID card.

### Medicaid

A letter or statement from a Medicaid agency dated within the last 30 days and outlining the coverage would work great! If you don't have that, an ID card that includes a current year date and your name would work, as well. Ultimately, we're looking for something that shows ALL the following:

- Your name
- Plan Name
- A recent transaction date (within 30 days) that shows us this coverage is currently in place for the current year specifically

### Individual or Preventative MEC plan

A recent bill or statement will usually do the trick, or you can provide a screenshot from your insurance provider's online portal or proof of a recent payment. Ultimately, we're looking for a document (or a combination of documents) that shows ALL of the following:

- Your name
- The plan name
- A recent transaction date (within 30 days) shows us this coverage is currently in place for the current year specifically.

### Student Insurance

A recent bill or statement will usually do the trick, or you can provide a screenshot from your insurance provider's online portal, a letter from your university confirming your health coverage for the current year, or a benefits election summary. Ultimately, we're looking for a document (or a combination of documents) that shows ALL the following:

- Your name
- The plan name
- A recent transaction date(within 30 days) that shows us this coverage is currently in place for the current year specifically
