# HRA Hub; Send an Invite link

## Send an invite link:

If an employee did not receive, or lost, their invite link, this function allows you to send a new invite link to the email the employee has on file.

1. On the People Management Table, find the employee you wish to send an invite to by using the search function or manually scrolling through the table. Select the ellipsis next to the employee you wish to send an invite to.

2. Select "Send sign-Up Link" from the menu.

If the invite link was sent, you will see this message.

If the user has already signed up, you will not be able to send another invite link to the individual.

Here is an example of what the invite will look like:
