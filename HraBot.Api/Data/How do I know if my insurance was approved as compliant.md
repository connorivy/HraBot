# How do I know if my insurance was approved as compliant?

After you upload proof of your insurance coverage, we'll review to make sure your plan qualifies for your HRA. You can always double check this in the dashboard of your member portal or under "Health Insurance." If you are not compliant, there will be a note there to tell you why. It could be that your plan itself does not qualify based on the guidelines, or it could be that more information is needed. Be sure to check on the note from our team!

Our compliance team may also send you an email asking for more information, so it's always a good idea to check your spam/junk folders in the days following your submission, in case they go there!
