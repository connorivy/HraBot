# Can employees without medical insurance claim reimbursement for their medical expenses through QSEHRA?

## What if my employee does not have insurance?

An employee must have a qualified health insurance plan, usually referred to as Minimum Essential Coverage, or MEC, in order to be eligible to participate in the QSEHRA. [See our explanation of what qualifies as MEC](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1690109-what-qualifies-as-minimum-essential-coverage-mec).

If your employee does not have medical insurance, or they only have short-term coverage or another non-qualified insurance plan, they cannot receive any reimbursements through the QSEHRA.
