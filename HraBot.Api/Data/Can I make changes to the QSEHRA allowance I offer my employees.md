# Can I make changes to the QSEHRA allowance I offer my employees?

How & when can I update the allowances I offer my employees through QSEHRA?

Sure! We can make changes to your account if you would like to change the rates.

A few things to keep in mind:

- The 2025 QSEHRA allowance maximums are:

  $6,350 ($529.16/ month) for single employees and $12,800 ($1066.66 / month) for families. These amounts will go up each year with inflation.

- Communication is key! If you are changing your rates, don't forget to let your employees know ASAP.

E-mail us at support@takecommandhealth.com or chat with us in the bottom right-hand corner with the changes you'd like to make, and we will update your plan and documents in a timely manner.
