# HRA Hub; Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

Once you have signed in ([Sign in page](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/sign-in-access)), you will then be prompted to set up your Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) account with the authenticator app.

(In the initial account set up phase, you will be able to go back and select an alternative authentication method if you like, by clicking the "Back to Selection." This option will be disabled or removed from view after the MFA method has been chosen or determined.)

If using the authenticator app, you will see the QR code to use in your authenticator app.

If you choose the email method, you'll need to authenticate your MFA with the code received in your email inbox.

**Important:** Once you have used your MFA method of choice, you cannot use the other methods as those will not work.
