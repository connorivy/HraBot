# When will I know if my application is approved?

It depends on the carrier and the time that you applied. This can take anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks. During open enrollment, when volumes are extremely high, some carriers will take longer to officially accept policies.

However, you can rest assured during open enrollment that as long as you submitted your application by the deadline and your policy is accepted, your coverage will be effective from the projected start date even if you haven't heard from the carrier yet.
