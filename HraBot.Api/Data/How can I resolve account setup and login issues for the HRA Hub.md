# How can I resolve account setup and login issues for the HRA Hub?

Successfully setting up and accessing your HRA Hub account may occasionally require troubleshooting due to incomplete processes, employer configurations, or login challenges. Below is a comprehensive guide to identifying and resolving these issues.

## Overview of HRA Hub Enrollment

HRA Hub is a platform used to manage your HRA (Health Reimbursement Arrangement) benefits. Before you can access the system, it is essential to:

- Activate your account via the welcome email you receive upon onboarding.
- Complete the initial sign-up process as outlined in the email.
- Work with your employer to ensure they have completed necessary configurations.

Skipping any of these steps can result in access issues, as detailed below.

## Steps to Onboard and Activate Your Account

### 1. Accessing the Welcome Email

- Look for the "Welcome to HRA Hub" email sent to your registered email address. It includes a link to start the onboarding process.
- If you cannot find this email, check your spam or junk folder.

### 2. Completing Onboarding

- Click the "Get Started" button in the welcome email.
- Follow the steps to set up your password and activate your account.
- **Note:** Password resets will not work until you've activated your account through the welcome email.

### 3. Employer Enrollment

Your employer must add you to their company's HRA roster for you to receive onboarding emails. If you haven't received this email, ask your employer to complete their configuration. Without this setup, individual accounts will not be created in the HRA Hub.

## Common Errors and How to Troubleshoot

### "User Doesn't Exist" Error

This may occur if your employer has not yet configured their HRA roster in the system. Ensure your email address was correctly added by your employer, then wait for the onboarding email after they complete their part.

### Issues Transitioning from the Old Platform

Employees who previously used the old Take Command login system must create a new password using their HRA Hub welcome email. Resetting an old password will not work. If needed, request that the email be resent.

### Blank Dashboard or Missing Open Enrollment Options

If you encounter a blank dashboard or cannot shop for plans, ensure you are signing into the new HRA Hub instead of the old platform. Use the credentials created during the onboarding process to log in.

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

- Always use the password set up during onboarding when signing in for the first time.
- Work with your employer to confirm that they have added you to the company's HRA roster.
- Check your "Welcome to HRA Hub" email for activation instructions, and verify that it is not in your spam or junk folder.
- Contact support or your employer if you suspect an issue with how your email was registered in the system.

By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth account setup and access process for HRA Hub. For additional support, reach out to your company's HR team or the Take Command support team.
