Note: steps are not considered complete until the item is fully complete and "continue" is clicked.

1. **HRA Documents**
   - Begin by reviewing and acknowledging the documents provided by Take Command. This ensures that all necessary information is understood and agreed upon.

2. **Set Up Employees**
   - Upload the employee roster or add employees individually. This step is crucial for tailoring the HRA plan to the company's workforce.

3. **AutoPay Set-Up**
   - Apply for your AutoPay account and connect your bank account. AutoPay is an optional step and can be completed before the HRA subscription can be purchased. Ensuring this is done guarantees that all financial transactions are handled efficiently and securely.

4. **Establish Date for Email Invitations**
   - Employers can set a date for sending out email invitations to newly added employees. This step helps in communicating the HRA plan to all relevant personnel.

5. **Set Up Subscription Billing**
   - Employers manage their payment methods and invoices through the subscription billing setup.
