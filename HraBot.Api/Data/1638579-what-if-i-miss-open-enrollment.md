# What if I miss open enrollment?

If you miss [open enrollment](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/individual-insurance-faqs/applying-during-open-enrollment/what-is-open-enrollment) and need health insurance, you'll need to qualify for "special enrollment" by having a qualifying life event to apply. The following list includes the most common qualifying life events:

- Losing existing health coverage
- Turning 26 and losing coverage through a parent's plan
- Getting married or divorced
- Having (or adopting) a baby
- Death in the family
- Moving to a different ZIP code or county
- Becoming a US citizen

Please see our article on [What is a Qualified Life Event](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/m61j6vi5/articles/articles/9448810/show) (QLE) if you are outside of open enrollment, and wish to shop.
