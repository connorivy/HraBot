# Why was my claim only partially reimbursed?

Why wasn't I reimbursed for my entire claim?

If you have a claim that is only partially reimbursed, in short, it means that you have used up your allowance year-to-date. But don't worry! You will still get reimbursed for the rest.

**Let's break it down:**

- Your HRA allowance is an annual benefit which is unlocked on a monthly basis for you to submit reimbursement requests against.
- When your total reimbursement claims YTD are more than your total available allowance YTD, it will leave a portion of your claims "unreimbursed."
- Our system will apply each month's new allowance **to the oldest claim first.**
- The "Reimbursed" column represents how much of a claim has been reported on your employer's monthly, semi-monthly or bi-weekly Reimbursement Statement that we provide them.
- The sum of the "Reimbursed" column is equal to your allowance YTD, or at least as of the date of your employer's last Reimbursement Statement.
- We will continue to track your unreimbursed claims over time and continue to apply each month's allowance to them until they are paid in full.

Here are a few examples of times when you may see this happen.

# Example #1 - Your premium is larger than your monthly allowance

For this example, let's use the following:

- Your HRA allowance is $400 per month
- Your monthly insurance premium is $600 per month
- You set up your recurring premium claim for $600 per month

In this case, our system will automatically create a $600 claim on your behalf each month. So in January, it's easy, right? You know January's $400 allowance is applied to your $600 claim for January.

But remember, each new allowance will be applied to the oldest claim first. That means that your February $400 allowance will first be applied to the remaining balance on the January premium claim until it's reimbursed in full.

This doesn't mean that in January, you received $600, and in February you received $200. It just means that YTD, you have been reimbursed or will be reimbursed $800 total, and the $800 was applied to your claims in order of their submission.

# Example #2 - You submit a large medical bill for reimbursement

Let's take a look at what happens in your account when you submit a medical bill that is larger than your monthly allowance.

For this example:

- Your HRA allowance is $400 per month
- Your HRA went into effect January 1st

In January, you go to the ER and have a $1,000 bill that you submit for reimbursement. As of January, you only have $400 available in reimbursement allowance. We will automatically apply your January $400 allowance to your claim, and we'll report to your employer that you are owed $400. But for the rest of the month, you'll see that it shows only $400 has been reimbursed.

Then in February, another $400 of HRA allowance will get unlocked. Even if you have submitted a new claim, your February allowance of $400 will get applied to the older claim first. So now January & February's $400 allowances are applied to the $1,000 hospital bill. In March the remaining balance of the ER visit will be reimbursed ($200) and the additional medical expense of $132.75 that was approved previously will now be reimbursed with the available funds.
