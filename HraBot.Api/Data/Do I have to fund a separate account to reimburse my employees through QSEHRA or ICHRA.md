# Do I have to fund a separate account to reimburse my employees through QSEHRA or ICHRA?

No. QSEHRA & ICHRA are reimbursement mechanisms for out of pocket expenses. Unlike FSAs and HSAs, QSEHRA and ICHRA plans are "arrangements," rather than accounts. All payments to your employees are to reimburse them for premiums and expenses they have already paid.
