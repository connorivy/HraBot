After adding family members and entering necessary details, review 'employee card' tags, confirming accuracy and selections. Once complete, click 'Continue' to proceed to Household income.

### My Info: Household income

The section allows you to enter your total annual household income to help Take Command assess if you are eligible for tax credits. You can use the salary estimation tool to enter your hourly rate, hours per week, and weeks per year to help determine the annual income for your household.

#### What is total household income and how is it used?

Total household income is the combined earnings of everyone in your household. It's used to determine eligibility for certain benefits and subsidies, like healthcare tax credits when selecting a health plan. Each covered working family member's income needs to be included in the annual household income, similar to how it is complete for IRS filings.

With the household income added, the Take Command system will complete a review of the information and advise the users of their eligibility.

It's very important to remember that you cannot accept a premium tax credit if you are claiming reimbursement through ICHRA. [Here is a little more about how ICHRA affects your tax credit.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/3213033-what-happens-to-premium-tax-credits-with-ichra)

## Tax credits

Regarding tax credits, it is important to take into consideration whether or not your ICHRA offer is considered "affordable."

- If it is deemed affordable, then the employee cannot accept tax credits.
- If it is deemed unaffordable, the employee can choose to either accept tax credits or the ICHRA reimbursement, but not both.
- If an employee accepts the HRA offer, the employee can still shop for a plan, click 'Show all plans' to continue.

The [Exchange website](https://www.healthcare.gov/marketplace-in-your-state/) will provide individuals information on how to determine affordability for ICHRA.

If tax credits are available to you and you choose to accept them and continue shopping, the Take Command platform will only show you plans that are available on exchange. You will be directed to enroll in that plan separately from our website.

When you enroll in health insurance coverage through the Exchange, the Exchange will ask you about any coverage offered to you by your employer, including through an HRA. Your ability to claim the premium tax credit may be limited if your employer offers you coverage, including an HRA. Lastly, the employee also has the option to accept the HRA offer and waive coverage.

## Choosing a plan

Shopping for a plan, can be tough.

### Recommended Plans:

The 'Recommended plans' section allows you to view recommendations based on your preferred doctor(s), hospital(s), and prescription(s) pre-selections. This provides you with only plans that meet your specific needs.

These are displayed on the first page for your convenience. To explore additional options, simply scroll down and click "Next" to view more plans.

If no plans match all of the entered preferences, the system will automatically keep the filters and display a blue toaster:

*You can 'clear all' filters to view all plans based on your zip code and county.

### Filtering and sorting

Filters allow employees to narrow down options with multiple selections. You'll also be able to filter out the many options based on your preferences for insurance carriers, doctor networks (PPO, EPO, HMO), and the ease of enrollment.

- **Doctor with location**: The Doctor Search tool is used to help determine if your selected doctor or specialist is in or out off network. Keeping your favorite doctors "in network" is critical to saving money. If you try to see a doctor that is out of network, your health plan won't help very much or may not pay anything at all.

- **Plan type**
  - **EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization)**: Hybrid of PPO and HMO. Enjoy lower premiums compared to PPO plans, and a referral is not required to see a specialist.
  - **HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)**: Lower monthly premiums are offered, but you must get a referral from your Primary Care Provider (PCP) before seeing a specialist.
  - **PPO**: Most flexible, yet most expensive network type. Do not need a referral to see a specialist. Option to see doctor outside preferred network.

- **Carrier**: based on ZIP Code searched and carriers available in the selected area.

- **Metal tier:**
  - **Platinum**: covers 90% on average of your medical costs; you pay 10%
  - **Gold**: covers 80% on average of your medical costs; you pay 20%
  - **Silver**: covers 70% on average of your medical costs; you pay 30%
  - **Bronze**: covers 60% on average of your medical costs; you pay 40%
  - **Extended Bronze**: Catastrophic policies pay after you have reached a very high deductible ($8,700 in 2022). Extended Bronze plans must also cover the first three primary care visits and preventive care for free, even if you have not yet met your deductible.

- **HSA Eligible**: This is a tax-advantaged account that allows you to put tax-deferred dollars into an account. At age 65, you may make eligible withdrawals from the account tax-free.

- **Enrollment Types:**
  - **Easy Enroll**: Plans with this tag will have an easy, fast enrollment! This means that you can complete the enrollment directly on the Take Command Health site, and we will even set up your recurring claim for you automatically. Take Command Health can provide additional support to you if anything comes up on your plan. We can work with the carriers on your behalf!
  - **Self Enroll**: For these plans, you'll need to enroll on your own, either directly with the carrier or with your state exchange. We will still help you narrow down which plan is best and then guide you on where to go from there. If an issue comes up with your plan, you'd need to call the carrier directly. We can always help provide guidance on how to do that, though.

You can also sort available plans by premium, max out of pocket, deductible in addition to low to high and high to low sorting.

**Compare Plans**: Utilize side-by-side comparison features to evaluate the pros and cons of each plan comprehensively

### Plan card details

The 'plan cards' provide a summary level of information for each healthcare plan, including costs and key features. These details showcase all of the information we have on each carrier and plans. The plans available to you are based on your zip code and county combination. On the plan cards, detailed information about the number of matching doctors, hospitals, and prescriptions will be shown when you hover over each one.

If no plans match the user's filters but filters were applied, plans will still be shown, and the plan cards will indicate "Providers: 1" or similar, where appropriate.

- **Monthly Premium**: The monthly fee required for coverage.
- **Deductible**: The amount you must pay out of pocket before your insurance starts covering costs.
- **Max Out-of-Pocket**: The maximum amount you'll have to pay for covered services in a plan year.
- **"My Cost" if Premium Exceeds Allowance**: This represents the difference between your allowance and the premium. It indicates what you would need to cover beyond your provided allowance.
- **Remaining Allowance**: The remaining portion of your allowance after deducting the premium. You can use it to pay for eligible medical expenses.

### View and Print Details

You can view and print the details of a plan for offline reference.

- **Plan Overview**: The plan is in full detail similar to the attached PDF.
- **Cost breakdown**: The amount you pay or the amount your allowance covers for your expenses
- **Doctors**: Presented based on the plan's network and coverage.
- **Prescriptions**: This represents the in-network or out-of-network prescriptions cost written by healthcare providers.
- **Hospitals**: Hospitals are medical facilities equipped with specialized staff, equipment, and resources to provide diagnosis, treatment, and care for a wide range of illnesses, injuries, and medical conditions.
- **Mental Health**: Mental and behavioral health inpatient services involve comprehensive treatment and care provided within a hospital setting for individuals experiencing acute psychiatric conditions or severe mental health crises.
- **Pregnancy & Maternity**: Includes Inpatient birth refers to the process of childbirth that occurs within a hospital or medical facility where the mother stays overnight for monitoring and medical care before, during, and after delivery, postnatal and prenatal care.
- **Emergency Care**: Refers to immediate medical attention provided to individuals who are experiencing sudden and often serious medical conditions or injuries that require urgent treatment. This care is typically provided in hospital emergency departments or urgent care.
