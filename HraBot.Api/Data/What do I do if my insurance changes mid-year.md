# What do I do if my insurance changes mid-year?

I got new insurance - what do I need to show you to update your system?

If you change your health insurance plan, you will need to submit a new [proof of coverage](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/managing-my-qsehra/qsehra-onboarding/what-is-proof-of-coverage). This can be:

- For QSEHRA - an ID card, bill, or enrollment paperwork
- For ICHRA - a monthly bill or enrollment paperwork

If you have your old premium set up as a recurring claim, you'll need to cancel that recurring claim. And if you intend to claim reimbursement for your new premium, you'll need to set up a new recurring claim. [Click here for instructions on how to update your recurring premium.](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2393788-how-do-i-update-my-recurring-premium-amount)

Remember, to be eligible to participate in your company's HRA (ICHRA or QSEHRA), your new insurance will still need to be an ICHRA or QSHERA approved plan.
