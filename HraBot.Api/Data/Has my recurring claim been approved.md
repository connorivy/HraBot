# Has my recurring claim been approved?

How do I know if I am set to receive my premium reimbursement each month?

If you want to claim reimbursement for your insurance premium each month, you can [set it up as a recurring premium claim](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/2284649-how-do-i-set-up-my-monthly-premium-as-a-recurring-expense). Just providing your proof of coverage during onboarding won't set up the actual reimbursement claim, so you'll need to take this one extra step to let our system know it's OK to create a claim on your behalf each month for your premium.

Once you set it up, you can confirm that it has been approved by clicking on [Health Insurance](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/health-insurance). If you have set one up, you'll see it listed there and can confirm it has been approved:
