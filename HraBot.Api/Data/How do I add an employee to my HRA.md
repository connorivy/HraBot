## How do I add a new employee to my HRA?

When you hire a new employee, you can easily add them to your employee roster through your member portal.

When you add your employee, you'll be asked to enter their hire date so we can determine their eligibility date, based on any waiting periods you've set. (If you do not have an eligibility wait period in your plan, then their start date & eligibility date are the same).

To add employees:

- In your Admin Member Portal, click on [Employee Roster--> Add Employee](https://app.takecommandhealth.com/member-portal/employee-roster)

Then you'll add the employee's name, e-mail, and hire date:

You can add as many employees as you'd like at one time. Once you hit submit, we'll send them an invitation to onboard onto the platform and help them get started using their benefits on their eligibility date. If you'd like to send the welcome email early so they can get logged in and start shopping, you can do that by clicking on the 3 dots next to their name on the Employee Roster.

Still not sure where to start? Check out our [Admin Resource Center](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/welcome-to-take-command-health-admin) for some helpful resources and support.
