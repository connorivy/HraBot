Overview of QSEHRA Rules

Written by Support  
Updated over a year ago

Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements, also known as QSEHRAs, were defined in December 2016 as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The idea behind QSEHRA was to give employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees the opportunity to offer their employees tax-free reimbursements for both health insurance premiums and eligible medical expenses. Since its inception, the IRS has issued [guidance](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-17-67.pdf) outlining how QSEHRA is set up and run.

## For the most comprehensive source of information, check out our [QSEHRA Guide](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/qsehra-guide) for a detailed description of all of the rules, requirements, and benefits!

Here's an overview of the QSEHRA rules to know before getting started.

## Key QSEHRA Rules to know

## For the Employer

- Must have fewer than 50 full-time employees
- Must not offer a group health plan to employees

## Eligible Employees

- QSEHRAs can exclude employees who have not completed 90 days of work, are under 25 years of age, are part-time or seasonal employees
- Employees must provide proof of coverage of their health insurance plan that meets the standards for [Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1690109-what-qualifies-as-minimum-essential-coverage-mec).
- Health insurance that meets MEC must be maintained in order to receive reimbursements tax-free.
- If employees receive a [premium tax credit](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/what-happens-to-premium-tax-credits-with-qsehra) for their insurance premiums from either their state or national marketplace (such as Healthcare.gov) they must notify the marketplace of the QSEHRA benefit. The QSEHRA benefit will reduce the premium tax credit of the employee dollar for dollar. (NOTE: This can vary according to the calculated affordability of the benefit, [for more information, click here!](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1643808-what-happens-to-premium-tax-credits-with-a-qsehra))

## Written Notice

- The employer must provide its eligible employees a [written notice](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/qsehra-employee-notice-deadline) to each eligible employee at least 90 days before the beginning of each year or, for an employee who is not eligible to participate at the beginning of the year, the date on which the employee is first eligible to participate in the QSEHRA.
- A penalty of $50 per employee (up to a maximum of $2,500 per calendar year per eligible employer) for failure to provide the written notice.
- We prepare this document for you, and it will be available to both you and your employees in your member portals.

## Reimbursements

- The QSEHRA can be set up to reimburse premiums only or premiums and [medical expenses](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/1717047-what-medical-expenses-are-reimbursable-through-my-hra).
- Employers reimburse their employees directly.

## Reporting

- For all QSEHRA reimbursements, the employer must report the amount of benefit the employee was eligible for on the [W-2 box 12 using code FF](https://www.takecommandhealth.com/blog/qsehra-and-w2-reporting).
- In addition, if the reimbursement is taxable (e.g. premiums paid on a pre-tax basis for coverage under a spouse's employer group health), they are also reported as wages subject to income tax withholding and are included in boxes 1, 3, and 5 on Form W-2.
