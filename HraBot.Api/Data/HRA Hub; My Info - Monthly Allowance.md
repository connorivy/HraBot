# HRA Hub; My Info - Monthly Allowance

This article explains the monthly allowance section of your shopping process.

## Overview:

The monthly allowance plays a critical role in the health plan selection process because it directly impacts your out-of-pocket expenses and affordability.

Your monthly allowance could be calculated based on a number of criteria that are set by your employer. Your monthly allowance can be applied towards your monthly insurance premium(s), or possibly medical expenses.

After adding family members and entering necessary details, review "employee card" tags, confirming accuracy and selections. Once complete, click 'Continue' to proceed to Household income.
