# How do I see my monthly allowance?

Consider the QSEHRA or ICHRA allowance as an annual benefit that is distributed monthly. Your annual allowance is prorated over the year.

You can view your monthly allocation on the Dashboard page under the Monthly Allowance section.

Throughout the year, we will track your total accumulated unclaimed allowance for you, so you know how much you have available to claim for reimbursement. That number is calculated as your total allowance "unlocked" year-to-date less the total claims made year-to-date.

Find your total unclaimed allowance on the dashboard in your member portal:

Note that this balance will take into consideration all approved claims, even if they have not yet been reimbursed.

If your company provides reimbursement for medical expenses and your Current Year Balance is $0.00, the "Add Expense" button will be disabled. You will notice this when the button is greyed out. This will remain unchanged until additional funds are accrued in your Current Year Balance.
