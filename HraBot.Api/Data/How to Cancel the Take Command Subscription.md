# Understanding Subscription Renewals

When your Take Command plan is set to renew, the existing plan settings are carried into the new year. However, you are not obligated to stay locked into the renewed plan for the entire year.

- Flexibility After Renewal: You can cancel your plan even after it renews. There is no required notice period for cancellations. For example, you can select the last day of a month in the admin portal as your plan's end date, and access will continue through that day. Your subscription ends after that date.

- Plan Changes: If you wish to make design changes to your plan (e.g., adjustments to allowances or eligibility requirements), these changes must be finalized before the renewal deadlines to ensure updated employee notices and documents for the upcoming plan year.

You can cancel the HRA anytime in your admin portal settings. Click into the 'Plan & Billing' tab and select cancel plan. There is no required notice period for cancellations. For example, you can select the last day of a month in the admin portal as your plan's end date, and access will continue through that day. Your subscription ends after that date.

# Submitting a Non-Renewal Request

If you want your subscription to end at the conclusion of your current term, such as by December 31, 2025, you must complete a non-renewal form. This ensures that your subscription will not carry over into the next plan year.

- Filling Out the Form: The designated non-renewal form is the required method to submit your request. Once the form has been submitted, your subscription is set to end on the specified date, such as the end of your term. No further action will be required.

- Preventing Automatic Renewal: If you do not see an option to cancel your plan through other means, submitting this form is the primary step to ensure non-renewal. Once completed, your plan will terminate at the end-of-term date, preventing it from renewing into the next year.

# Clarification on Renewal Emails

A common misunderstanding arises from renewal emails. It's important to note that:

- These emails are reminders of regular monthly billing for your Take Command platform and do not signify automatic renewals for the next plan year.

Important Notes:

- Flexibility to cancel plans anytime without prior notice
- Detailed instructions available for non-renewal to ensure complete control over plan transitions.
- If your employees have active coverage, their insurance plans will not be directly affected - they have the choice to keep the plan they have and continue making payments directly to the insurance carrier - or to cancel that plan by contacting the carrier directly.
- The Take Command subscription will cancel the last day of the month you chose, and you will have access until then. Please be sure to download any reports before the cancellation is complete.
- We will still send any necessary end of year documentation for tax reporting purposes
