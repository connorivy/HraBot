# HRA Hub; Shopping for an Insurance Plan - Getting Started

Shopping for an Insurance Plan

Shopping for a plan can be tough but with guidance we're here to help. Glossary of definitions can be found [here](https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/2529879/downloadable_documents/health_insurance_terms_101.pdf).

## Getting Started:

## My Info: Personal Info

Profile information needs to be entered for you and any family members who will be covered under the medical insurance plan if applicable.

You are then required to acknowledge legal documents, which will be stored in your portal.

**Review your HRA documents:** Be sure to review them so you can understand and make the most of your new HRA benefit! Please read the Employee Notice for important information about how it may affect your eligibility to receive a premium tax credit. But don't worry - we'll walk you through it! At any time, you can return to the dashboard.

(If you are enrolled in Medicaid, you will be routed to the waive questions as you are not eligible to participate in an HRA. Employees need to be enrolled in insurance that is considered individual health insurance. Medicaid does not fit this type of insurance and does not qualify as a participating plan for the ICHRA benefit.)

You will be given the option to waive coverage via the popup modal or waive link if you do not want to participate in the HRA offering being provided by your employer. You will be asked to share the reason for your decision to waive.
