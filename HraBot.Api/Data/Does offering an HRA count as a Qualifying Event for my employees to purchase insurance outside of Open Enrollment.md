# Does offering an HRA count as a Qualifying Event for my employees to purchase insurance outside of Open Enrollment?

Can employees on an ICHRA or QSEHRA shop for plans during Special Enrollment?

Yes. To participate in an ICHRA, employees will need to maintain coverage in a qualified individual health plan. Open Enrollment for individual plans varies by state, but in general runs from November 1st to December 15th each year. Outside of Open Enrollment, individuals need a qualifying life event to trigger a Special Enrollment Period to purchase a plan; events such as marriage, divorce, having a baby, and moving qualify.

But good news! **Employers offering an ICHRA or QSEHRA will trigger a special enrollment period for employees, giving them 60 days from their eligibility date to buy a plan.** Which means employers can set up an ICHRA at any time during the year and employees are able to shop for qualified individual plans on the marketplace year-round.

**Employees with a Jan 1 ICHRA start date will need to purchase insurance during the regular open enrollment season (Nov 1- Dec 15 in most states).**
