# I just had a birthday, when does my new allowance kick in?

My company reimburses based on age, when does my new allowance start?

Some employers can vary their reimbursement rates by age. Most marketplace plans offer premiums in a 1:3 ratio for individuals ages 26-64. For example, you could set reimbursement rates for a 26-year-old $100/mo and a 64-year-old $300/mo using the 1:3 ratio. A 37-year-old employee gets whatever amount on the linear line in between the 26 and 64-year-old—Get ready to dust off your old algebra skills! The answer for the 37-year-old in this example is $158/mo.

## So what happens if you have a birthday during the year and are now eligible for a higher reimbursement?

The change in allowance does not go into effect until the following year. So if your birthday is in August, you will receive a higher monthly allowance in January of the following year.

Once your insurance ends in December and you sign up for a new plan for the year, you will have a higher reimbursement amount to go towards that premium.
