## Filter:

There are 2 filter menus available in the People table, Filter by status and Filter by class. By selecting one, or many, filter options the table will automatically filter down to what you wish to see.

If you select Filter by status, the options that show will be:

- Active
- Enrolled
- Ineligible
- Invited
- In Waiting Period
- Onboarding
- Opted Out
- Pending Invite
- Waived
- Inactive
- Suspended
- Terminated

If you select Filter by class, all of the class options set for your company will appear.

## Terminate an employee:

Admins will want to initiate this function when an employee on their roster is no longer ineligible to participate in the HRA. Besides an employee no longer being employed with your company, it could also be that they become ineligible, based on other company policies.

### Scheduling a termination date

When scheduling a termination, here are some things to remember:

- The option to change the termination date is only available when editing the employee profile.

- When modifying the termination date, the same termination date selector rules apply as when defining it initially. Those are:
  - Today's Date
  - **Future Dates:**
    - If selected, the termination event will occur on the specified date.
  - **Invalid Dates (Past Dates or Beyond 60 Days from Today):**
    - These dates cannot be selected.
    - If an invalid date is manually entered, you will see the following message: "You must pick a day between today and MM/DD/YYYY (plus 60 days from the current date)".

- **Saving Changes:**
  - Any modifications to the termination date will not take effect until the profile is saved.

### Steps to terminate

1. On the People table, find the employee you wish to terminate by using the search function or manually scrolling through the table.

2. Select the name of the employee you wish to terminate.

3. Select "Terminate" in red at the top of the table.

4. Use the date selector to schedule the termination.

5. Enter "TERMINATE" in the box to confirm.

6. Select "Schedule Termination" in red.

7. When you return to the People table, they will now appear in the "Inactive" tab.

## Send an invite link:

If an employee did not receive, or lost, their invite link, this function allows you to send a new invite link to the email the employee has on file.

1. On the People table, find the employee you wish to send the link to by using the search function or manually scrolling through the table.

2. Select the name of the employee.

3. Select "Send Sign-up Link" at the top of the table.
   - If the invite link was sent, you will see this message.
   - If the user has already signed up, you will not be able to send another invite link to the individual.

Here is an example of what the invite will look like:
