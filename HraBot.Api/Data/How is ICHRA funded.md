# How is ICHRA funded?

Do we need to pre-fund an ICHRA account?

ICHRA (as well as QSEHRA) is a reimbursement arrangement rather than an account. This means that employees will typically pay for insurance or medical care themselves and then file a reimbursement claim. Employers only pay out funds to employees when a claim is made and approved. While some employers may choose to setup separate bank accounts for tracking purposes, it is not required.
