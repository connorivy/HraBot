# I already have a plan for this year. How do I get set up for ICHRA reimbursement?

When you log in to your member portal for the first time, you'll automatically be placed into the HRA onboarding or enrollment flow. On the second page of the onboarding flow, you will have an option to "see if my current plan qualifies."

We'll then ask you what type of plan you have, and then walk you through the onboarding flow, asking you to provide proof of your 2024 plan.

Next, you'll be prompted to read through your plan documents! Make sure and at least skim through these, so you have a decent idea of how your HRA works, and how to maximize your benefits! Make sure you check this box once you've done that in order to continue:

Then you'll be asked to choose what plan type you have here!

**Screenshot shows:** Options for Individual Health Insurance, Medicare, Student Health Insurance

If you choose Individual Health Insurance, you'll be prompted to enter your zipcode and choose your insurance carrier. Note: if you do not see your insurance carrier listed, you may not have a qualified health plan for ICHRA. Chat with us in the bottom right so we can confirm for you!

Then, you'll be prompted to give us a bit more information about yourself.

Next, you'll just tell us a bit more about the dates of your coverage, and the amount of your premium!

**Screenshot shows:** Fields for coverage dates and premium amount

Now, it's time to upload your proof of coverage documentation! Be sure that the document you provide shows your name, a 2024 date, and your 2024 premium! Usually, a premium bill works best.

From there, you can enter any additional premiums you'd like to claim reimbursement for (dental, vision, etc.). Our compliance team will review your document within 7-10 business days and let you know if they need any other information from you.

Once it's approved, we'll start reporting claims to your employer for reimbursement, and they'll reimburse you directly from there!

If you have any trouble while going through the process, feel free to chat with us in the bottom right and let us know.
