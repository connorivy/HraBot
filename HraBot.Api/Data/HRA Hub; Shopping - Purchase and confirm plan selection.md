## Completing Your Insurance Plan Purchase

You're almost there!

After selecting your plan, it's time to take the final steps to purchase your insurance and receive confirmation. Here's a simple guide to make sure everything goes smoothly.

(If you selected a 'self enroll' plan, proceed [here](https://intercom.help/take-command-health/en/articles/9949244-shopping-self-enroll-with-autopay))

**Upcoming:**
- Carrier questions
- Mailing Address
- Additional info
- Signatures
- Summary
- Payment info

## 1. Insurance Carrier questions:

Once you've chosen your plan, you may need to answer some insurance carrier-specific questions. These are required for completing the specific carrier application. Don't worry; Take Command handles this for you, ensuring all necessary questions are included. Once these questions are answered, click continue to 'Mailing Address'.

## 2. Mailing address:

In the application process, you have the option to keep your mailing address the same as entered or update it as needed. Here's how you can manage your mailing address effectively:

- **Keeping the Same Address:** If you wish to keep your mailing address unchanged from a previous entry, simply click continue.
- **Editing the Address:** If you need to make changes to your mailing address, you can "edit" directly on the form. This allows you to modify the address details as required.
- **Saving Progress:** The application automatically saves your progress when you click "continue." This ensures that your mailing address choice is recorded and maintained throughout the application process.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** To maintain accuracy and compliance, the application requires all fields to be valid and filled out before allowing you to continue. If any errors occur, such as an invalid address format or the presence of a P.O. Box, the application will prompt you with a red error message: "Address invalid. Enter a valid address. P.O. Boxes are not allowed."

Click continue to continue to the next page in the application process.

## 3. Additional Information Required for Purchase:

To proceed with purchasing your health plan, you'll need to provide some additional information, including Social Security Numbers (SSN) for everyone covered under the plan, including dependents under 18. Your Social Security Number (SSN) is required for carrier application submission for identification and verification purposes.

## 4. Applicant Signatures:

For each individual selected for a health plan, you'll need to provide a digital signature. This ensures that everyone included in the plan acknowledges and agrees to the health plan selection. Here's how you can do it easily with our user-friendly digital signature feature.

- **Signature Field for Each Shopping Person:**
  - Adults or those over 18 years old will need to sign individually.
  - Each signature field is tailored to the person selected for the health plan, making it easy to confirm their choice.

- **Validation of Input Fields:**
  - Before proceeding, ensure that all required input fields, including signatures, are filled out accurately.
  - The "continue" button will remain disabled until all input fields are valid, preventing any errors.

- **Seamless Navigation:**
  - If you need to make changes or review sensitive information such as Social Security Numbers (SSNs), you can easily navigate back to the relevant sections.
  - Once all signatures and input fields are complete and valid, proceed forward to the final summary plan.

## 5. Summary and Purchase:

Next, you'll land on the final summary page.

During this stage, it is recommended that you complete the following:

- **View Summary and Make Changes:** Review your selections and make any necessary adjustments, such as going back to remove or add a different plan.
- **Save to Complete Later:** If you need more time, save your progress to complete the enrollment at a later time by returning to the dashboard at any time.
- **Complete Enrollment:** Once satisfied, proceed to complete enrollment. Upon successful completion, you'll receive a printable "success" screen.

## 6. Purchase a plan with CC or ACH:

If you selected an 'easy-enroll' plan, you will now be directed to the Payment Details page (unless your company is enrolled in Autopay). On this page, you will securely enter your payment details by choosing between credit card (CC) or ACH.

Once the payment information is submitted, you will be routed to the "Additional Premiums" page to complete the next steps of the enrollment process.

## 7. Final Success Page

Depending on your employer's preferences, the "success" screen may offer the option to select a dental partner for dental insurance needs. These partners have dedicated landing pages for users to complete the application process directly with the dental carrier.

After completing the purchase, you'll receive an automated message confirming your successful enrollment. Your portal will be promptly updated with the new information, providing reassurance that your insurance coverage is secured.
